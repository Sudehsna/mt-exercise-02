CHAPTER 1 .
<unk> .
<unk> me Ishmael .
Some years ago — never mind how long precisely — having little or no money in my purse , and nothing particular to interest me on shore , I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world .
It is a way I have of driving off the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> I find myself growing grim about the mouth ; whenever it is a damp , <unk> <unk> in my soul ; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin <unk> , and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet ; and especially whenever my <unk> get such an upper hand of me , that it requires a strong <unk> principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street , and <unk> knocking people ’ s hats off — then , I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can .
This is my <unk> for pistol and ball .
With a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> himself upon his sword ; I quietly take to the ship .
There is nothing surprising in this .
If they but knew it , almost all men in their degree , some time or other , cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me .
There now is your insular city of the <unk> , <unk> round by wharves as Indian isles by coral <unk> — commerce <unk> it with her surf .
Right and left , the streets take you <unk> .
<unk> extreme <unk> is the <unk> , where that noble <unk> is washed by waves , and <unk> by breezes , which a few hours previous were out of sight of land .
Look at the crowds of <unk> there .
<unk> the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon .
Go from <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , and from thence , by <unk> , northward .
What do you see ? — <unk> like silent <unk> all around the town , stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries .
Some leaning against the <unk> ; some seated upon the <unk> ; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China ; some high aloft in the rigging , as if striving to get a still better <unk> peep .
But these are all landsmen ; of week days <unk> up in <unk> and <unk> — tied to <unk> , nailed to <unk> , <unk> to <unk> .
How then is this ?
Are the green fields gone ?
What do they here ?
But look !
here come more crowds , pacing straight for the water , and seemingly bound for a dive .
<unk> !
Nothing will content them but the <unk> limit of the land ; <unk> under the <unk> lee of yonder <unk> will not <unk> .
No .
They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in .
And there they stand — miles of them — leagues .
<unk> all , they come from <unk> and <unk> , streets and <unk> — north , east , south , and west .
Yet here they all unite .
Tell me , does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships <unk> them thither ?
Once more .
Say you are in the country ; in some high land of <unk> .
Take almost any path you please , and ten to one it carries you down in a <unk> , and leaves you there by a pool in the stream .
There is magic in it .
Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries — stand that man on his legs , set his feet <unk> , and he will infallibly lead you to water , if water there be in all that region .
<unk> you ever be <unk> in the great American desert , try this experiment , if your <unk> happen to be supplied with a <unk> professor .
Yes , as every one knows , meditation and water are wedded for ever .
But here is an artist .
He desires to paint you the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , most <unk> bit of romantic <unk> in all the valley of the <unk> .
What is the chief element he <unk> ?
There stand his trees , each with a hollow trunk , as if a <unk> and a <unk> were within ; and here sleeps his meadow , and there sleep his cattle ; and up from yonder <unk> goes a sleepy smoke .
<unk> into distant <unk> winds a <unk> way , reaching to <unk> <unk> of mountains <unk> in their <unk> blue .
But though the picture lies thus <unk> , and though this <unk> shakes down its <unk> like leaves upon this <unk> ’ s head , yet all were vain , unless the <unk> ’ s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him .
Go visit the <unk> in <unk> , when for scores on scores of miles you <unk> <unk> among <unk> — what is the one charm wanting ? — Water — there is not a drop of water there !
Were <unk> but a <unk> of sand , would you travel your thousand miles to see it ?
Why did the poor <unk> of <unk> , upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver , deliberate whether to <unk> him a coat , which he sadly needed , or invest his money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> ?
Why is almost every <unk> healthy boy with a <unk> healthy soul in him , at some time or other crazy to go to sea ?
Why upon your first voyage as a passenger , did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration , when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land ?
Why did the old <unk> hold the sea holy ?
Why did the <unk> give it a separate <unk> , and own brother of Jove ?
Surely all this is not without meaning .
And still deeper the meaning of that story of <unk> , who because he could not grasp the <unk> , mild image he saw in the fountain , plunged into it and was drowned .
But that same image , we ourselves see in all <unk> and oceans .
It is the image of the <unk> phantom of life ; and this is the key to it all .
Now , when I say that I am in the <unk> of going to sea whenever I begin to grow <unk> about the eyes , and begin to be over conscious of my lungs , I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger .
For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse , and a purse is but a <unk> unless you have something in it .
Besides , passengers get <unk> — grow <unk> — don ’ t sleep of nights — do not enjoy themselves much , as a general thing ; — no , I never go as a passenger ; nor , though I am something of a salt , do I ever go to sea as a Commodore , or a Captain , or a Cook .
I <unk> the glory and distinction of such <unk> to those who like them .
For my part , I <unk> all honorable <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> of every kind whatsoever .
It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself , without taking care of ships , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and what not .
And as for going as cook , — though I confess there is considerable glory in that , a cook being a sort of officer on <unk> — yet , somehow , I never fancied <unk> fowls ; — though once <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> salted and <unk> , there is no one who will speak more respectfully , not to say <unk> , of a <unk> fowl than I will .
It is out of the <unk> <unk> of the old Egyptians upon <unk> <unk> and <unk> river horse , that you see the <unk> of those creatures in their huge <unk> the <unk> .
No , when I go to sea , I go as a simple sailor , right before the mast , <unk> down into the forecastle , aloft there to the royal mast-head .
True , they rather order me about some , and make me jump from spar to spar , like a <unk> in a May meadow .
And at first , this sort of thing is <unk> enough .
It <unk> one ’ s sense of honor , particularly if you come of an old <unk> family in the land , the <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> .
And more than all , if just previous to putting your hand into the <unk> , you have been <unk> it as a country schoolmaster , making the <unk> boys stand in awe of you .
The transition is a keen one , I assure you , from a schoolmaster to a sailor , and requires a strong <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> to enable you to grin and bear it .
But even this wears off in time .
What of it , if some old <unk> of a <unk> orders me to get a <unk> and sweep down the decks ?
What does that <unk> amount to , <unk> , I mean , in the scales of the New <unk> ?
Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me , because I <unk> and respectfully obey that old <unk> in that particular instance ?
Who ain ’ t a slave ?
Tell me that .
Well , then , however the old <unk> may order me about — however they may thump and punch me about , I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right ; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way — either in a physical or <unk> point of view , that is ; and so the universal thump is passed round , and all hands should <unk> each other ’ s <unk> , and be content .
Again , I always go to sea as a sailor , because they make a point of paying me for my trouble , whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of .
On the contrary , passengers themselves must pay .
And there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid .
The act of paying is perhaps the most <unk> <unk> that the two <unk> <unk> <unk> upon us .
But _ being paid _ , — what will compare with it ?
The <unk> activity with which a man <unk> money is really marvellous , considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly <unk> , and that on no account can a <unk> man enter heaven .
Ah !
how <unk> we <unk> ourselves to <unk> !
<unk> , I always go to sea as a sailor , because of the <unk> <unk> and pure air of the <unk> deck .
For as in this world , head winds are far more <unk> than winds from astern ( that is , if you never <unk> the <unk> <unk> ) , so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle .
He thinks he breathes it first ; but not so .
In much the same way do the <unk> lead their <unk> in many other things , at the same time that the <unk> little <unk> it .
But wherefore it was that after having <unk> <unk> the sea as a merchant sailor , I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage ; this the invisible <unk> officer of the Fates , who has the constant <unk> of me , and <unk> dogs me , and influences me in some unaccountable way — he can better answer than any one else .
And , doubtless , my going on this whaling voyage , formed part of the grand <unk> of <unk> that was drawn up a long time ago .
It came in as a sort of brief interlude and <unk> between more <unk> performances .
I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this : “ _ Grand <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of the United States . _ “ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
“ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . ” Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage <unk> , the Fates , put me down for this <unk> part of a whaling voyage , when others were set down for <unk> parts in high <unk> , and short and easy parts in <unk> <unk> , and jolly parts in <unk> — though I cannot tell why this was exactly ; yet , now that I recall all the circumstances , I think I can see a little into the <unk> and motives which being <unk> presented to me under various <unk> , induced me to set about performing the part I did , besides <unk> me into the <unk> that it was a choice <unk> from my own <unk> <unk> and <unk> judgment .
Chief among these motives was the <unk> idea of the great whale himself .
Such a portentous and mysterious monster <unk> all my curiosity .
Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk ; the <unk> , nameless perils of the whale ; these , with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds , helped to sway me to my wish .
With other men , perhaps , such things would not have been <unk> ; but as for me , I am tormented with an everlasting <unk> for things remote .
I love to sail <unk> seas , and land on <unk> coasts .
Not <unk> what is good , I am quick to perceive a horror , and could still be social with it — would they let me — since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the <unk> of the place one <unk> in .
By reason of these things , then , the whaling voyage was welcome ; the great <unk> of the <unk> swung open , and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose , two and two there floated into my <unk> soul , endless <unk> of the whale , and , <unk> most of them all , one grand hooded phantom , like a snow hill in the air .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
I stuffed a shirt or two into my old <unk> , <unk> it under my arm , and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific .
<unk> the good city of old <unk> , I duly arrived in New Bedford .
It was a Saturday night in December .
Much was I <unk> upon learning that the little <unk> for Nantucket had already sailed , and that no way of reaching that place would offer , till the following <unk> .
As most young <unk> for the pains and <unk> of whaling stop at this same New Bedford , thence to embark on their voyage , it may as well be related that I , for one , had no idea of so doing .
For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft , because there was a fine , <unk> something about everything connected with that famous old island , which <unk> pleased me .
Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually <unk> the business of whaling , and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her , yet Nantucket was her great original — the <unk> of this <unk> ; — the place where the first dead American whale was stranded .
Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen , the <unk> , first <unk> out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan ?
And where but from Nantucket , too , did that first adventurous little <unk> put forth , partly laden with <unk> <unk> — so goes the story — to throw at the whales , in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit ?
Now having a night , a day , and still another night following before me in New Bedford , ere I could embark for my destined port , it became a matter of <unk> where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile .
It was a very <unk> , nay , a very dark and dismal night , <unk> cold and <unk> .
I knew no one in the place .
With anxious <unk> I had sounded my pocket , and only brought up a few pieces of silver , — So , wherever you go , Ishmael , said I to myself , as I stood in the middle of a dreary street <unk> my bag , and <unk> the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south — wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to <unk> for the night , my dear Ishmael , be sure to <unk> the <unk> , and don ’ t be too particular .
With <unk> steps I paced the streets , and passed the sign of “ The <unk> <unk> ” — but it looked too <unk> and jolly there .
<unk> on , from the bright red windows of the “ <unk> Inn , ” there came such <unk> rays , that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house , for everywhere else the <unk> frost lay ten inches thick in a hard , <unk> <unk> , — rather weary for me , when I struck my foot against the <unk> <unk> , because from hard , remorseless service the <unk> of my boots were in a most miserable plight .
<unk> <unk> and jolly , again thought I , pausing one moment to watch the broad <unk> in the street , and hear the sounds of the <unk> glasses within .
But go on , Ishmael , said I at last ; don ’ t you hear ?
get away from before the door ; your patched boots are stopping the way .
So on I went .
I now by instinct followed the streets that took me <unk> , for there , doubtless , were the <unk> , if not the <unk> <unk> .
Such dreary streets !
blocks of blackness , not houses , on either hand , and here and there a candle , like a candle moving about in a tomb .
At this hour of the night , of the last day of the week , that quarter of the town proved all but deserted .
But presently I came to a <unk> light proceeding from a low , wide <unk> , the door of which stood <unk> open .
It had a careless look , as if it were meant for the uses of the public ; so , entering , the first thing I did was to <unk> over an <unk> in the <unk> .
Ha !
thought I , ha , as the flying <unk> almost <unk> me , are these ashes from that destroyed city , <unk> ?
But “ The <unk> <unk> , ” and “ The <unk> ? ” — this , then must needs be the sign of “ The <unk> . ” However , I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within , pushed on and opened a second , interior door .
It seemed the great Black <unk> sitting in <unk> .
A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to <unk> ; and beyond , a black <unk> of <unk> was beating a book in a pulpit .
It was a negro church ; and the preacher ’ s text was about the blackness of darkness , and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> there .
Ha , Ishmael , muttered I , backing out , <unk> <unk> at the sign of ‘ The <unk> ! ’ <unk> on , I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks , and heard a <unk> <unk> in the air ; and looking up , saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it , <unk> representing a tall straight jet of <unk> spray , and these words <unk> — “ The <unk> Inn : — Peter Coffin . ” Coffin ? — <unk> ? — Rather <unk> in that particular connexion , thought I.
But it is a common name in Nantucket , they say , and I suppose this Peter here is an <unk> from there .
As the light looked so dim , and the place , for the time , looked quiet enough , and the <unk> little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been <unk> here from the <unk> of some burnt <unk> , and as the swinging sign had a <unk> sort of <unk> to it , I thought that here was the very spot for <unk> <unk> , and the best of <unk> <unk> .
It was a queer sort of place — a <unk> old house , one side <unk> as it were , and leaning over sadly .
It stood on a sharp <unk> corner , where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paul ’ s tossed craft .
Euroclydon , nevertheless , is a mighty pleasant <unk> to any one <unk> , with his feet on the <unk> quietly <unk> for bed .
“ In <unk> of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon , ” says an old <unk> — of whose works I possess the only copy <unk> — “ it maketh a marvellous difference , whether thou <unk> out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside , or whether thou <unk> it from that <unk> window , where the frost is on both sides , and of which the wight Death is the only <unk> . ” True enough , thought I , as this passage occurred to my mind — old <unk> , thou <unk> well .
Yes , these eyes are windows , and this body of mine is the house .
What a pity they didn ’ t stop up the <unk> and the <unk> though , and thrust in a little <unk> here and there .
But it ’ s too late to make any <unk> now .
The universe is finished ; the <unk> is on , and the chips were <unk> off a <unk> years ago .
Poor Lazarus there , <unk> his teeth against the <unk> for his pillow , and shaking off his <unk> with his <unk> , he might <unk> up both ears with <unk> , and put a <unk> into his mouth , and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon .
Euroclydon !
says old <unk> , in his red <unk> <unk> — ( he had a <unk> one afterwards ) <unk> , <unk> !
What a fine frosty night ; how <unk> <unk> ; what northern lights !
Let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting <unk> ; give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals .
But what thinks Lazarus ?
Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights ?
Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here ?
Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator ; yea , ye gods !
go down to the fiery pit itself , in order to keep out this frost ?
Now , that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the <unk> before the door of <unk> , this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the <unk> .
Yet <unk> himself , he too lives like a Czar in an ice <unk> made of frozen <unk> , and being a <unk> of a <unk> society , he only <unk> the <unk> tears of orphans .
But no more of this <unk> now , we are going a-whaling , and there is plenty of that yet to come .
Let us scrape the ice from our <unk> feet , and see what sort of a place this “ <unk> ” may be .
CHAPTER 3 .
The Spouter-Inn .
<unk> that <unk> Spouter-Inn , you found yourself in a wide , low , <unk> entry with old-fashioned <unk> , <unk> one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft .
On one side hung a very large <unk> so <unk> <unk> , and every way <unk> , that in the <unk> <unk> by which you viewed it , it was only by <unk> study and a series of <unk> visits to it , and careful inquiry of the <unk> , that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose .
Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows , that at first you almost thought some <unk> young artist , in the time of the New England <unk> , had <unk> to <unk> chaos <unk> .
But by <unk> of much and earnest <unk> , and <unk> repeated <unk> , and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry , you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea , however wild , might not be altogether <unk> .
But what most <unk> and confounded you was a long , limber , portentous , black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue , dim , perpendicular lines floating in a nameless <unk> .
A <unk> , <unk> , <unk> picture truly , enough to drive a nervous man distracted .
Yet was there a sort of indefinite , <unk> , unimaginable <unk> about it that fairly <unk> you to it , till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant .
<unk> and anon a bright , but , alas , <unk> idea would dart you through . — It ’ s the Black Sea in a midnight gale . — It ’ s the unnatural <unk> of the four primal elements . — It ’ s a blasted <unk> . — It ’ s a <unk> winter scene . — It ’ s the <unk> of the <unk> stream of Time .
But at last all these <unk> <unk> to that one portentous something in the picture ’ s midst .
_ That _ once found out , and all the rest were plain .
But stop ; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish ?
even the great leviathan himself ?
In fact , the artist ’ s design seemed this : a final theory of my own , partly based upon the <unk> <unk> of many aged persons with whom I <unk> upon the subject .
The picture <unk> a <unk> in a great <unk> ; the <unk> ship <unk> there with its three <unk> masts alone visible ; and an exasperated whale , <unk> to spring clean over the craft , is in the enormous act of <unk> himself upon the three mast-heads .
The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous <unk> and spears .
Some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory <unk> ; others were tufted with <unk> of human hair ; and one was <unk> , with a vast handle sweeping round like the <unk> made in the <unk> grass by a <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> as you gazed , and <unk> what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a <unk> with such a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> with these were <unk> old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and <unk> .
Some were <unk> weapons .
With this once long lance , now wildly <unk> , fifty years ago did <unk> <unk> kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset .
And that harpoon — so like a <unk> now — was flung in <unk> seas , and run away with by a whale , years afterwards slain off the Cape of <unk> .
The original iron entered nigh the tail , and , like a <unk> needle <unk> in the body of a man , <unk> full forty feet , and at last was found <unk> in the hump .
<unk> this dusky entry , and on through yon <unk> way — cut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with <unk> all round — you enter the public room .
A still <unk> place is this , with such low ponderous beams above , and such old wrinkled planks beneath , that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft ’ s <unk> , especially of such a howling night , when this <unk> old ark rocked so furiously .
On one side stood a long , low , <unk> table covered with cracked glass cases , filled with <unk> <unk> gathered from this wide world ’ s remotest <unk> .
<unk> from the further angle of the room stands a <unk> den — the bar — a rude attempt at a right whale ’ s head .
Be that how it may , there stands the vast arched bone of the whale ’ s jaw , so wide , a <unk> might almost drive beneath it .
<unk> are <unk> <unk> , ranged round with old <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ; and in those jaws of swift destruction , like another cursed Jonah ( by which name indeed they called him ) , <unk> a little <unk> old man , who , for their money , <unk> <unk> the sailors <unk> and death .
<unk> are the <unk> into which he <unk> his poison .
Though true <unk> without — within , the <unk> green <unk> glasses <unk> <unk> downwards to a <unk> bottom .
<unk> meridians <unk> <unk> into the glass , <unk> these <unk> ’ <unk> .
<unk> to _ this _ mark , and your charge is but a penny ; to _ this _ a penny more ; and so on to the full glass — the Cape Horn measure , which you may <unk> down for a <unk> .
Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a table , <unk> by a dim light divers <unk> of _ <unk> _ .
I sought the landlord , and telling him I desired to be <unk> with a room , received for answer that his house was full — not a bed <unk> .
“ But avast , ” he added , <unk> his forehead , “ you <unk> no <unk> to sharing a harpooneer ’ s blanket , have ye ?
I s ’ <unk> you are goin ’ <unk> ’ , so you ’ d better get used to that sort of thing . ” I told him that I never <unk> to sleep two in a bed ; that if I should ever do so , it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be , and that if he ( the landlord ) really had no other place for me , and the harpooneer was not <unk> <unk> , why rather than <unk> further about a strange town on so bitter a night , I would put up with the half of any decent man ’ s blanket .
“ I thought so .
All right ; take a seat .
Supper ? — you want supper ?
Supper ’ ll be ready directly . ” I sat down on an old wooden settle , carved all over like a bench on the <unk> .
At one end a <unk> tar was still further <unk> it with his jack-knife , stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs .
He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail , but he didn ’ t make much headway , I thought .
At last some four or five of us were summoned to our <unk> in an <unk> room .
It was cold as <unk> — no fire at all — the landlord said he couldn ’ t afford it .
Nothing but two dismal <unk> candles , each in a winding sheet .
We were fain to <unk> up our monkey jackets , and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers .
But the fare was of the most <unk> kind — not only meat and <unk> , but dumplings ; good heavens !
dumplings for supper !
One young fellow in a green box coat , addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner .
“ My boy , ” said the landlord , “ you ’ ll have the <unk> to a dead <unk> . ” “ Landlord , ” I whispered , “ that <unk> the harpooneer is it ? ” “ Oh , no , ” said he , looking a sort of <unk> funny , “ the harpooneer is a dark <unk> chap .
He never <unk> dumplings , he don ’ t — he <unk> nothing but <unk> , and he <unk> ’ em rare . ” “ The devil he does , ” says I.
“ Where is that harpooneer ?
Is he here ? ” “ He ’ ll be here afore long , ” was the answer .
I could not help it , but I began to feel suspicious of this “ dark <unk> ” harpooneer .
At any rate , I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together , he must <unk> and get into bed before I did .
Supper over , the company went back to the bar-room , when , knowing not what else to do with myself , I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a <unk> on .
Presently a <unk> noise was heard without .
<unk> up , the landlord cried , “ That ’ s the Grampus ’ s crew .
I <unk> her reported in the offing this morning ; a three years ’ voyage , and a full ship .
Hurrah , boys ; now we ’ ll have the <unk> news from the <unk> . ” A <unk> of sea boots was heard in the entry ; the door was flung open , and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough .
<unk> in their shaggy watch <unk> , and with their heads muffled in woollen <unk> , all <unk> and ragged , and their <unk> stiff with <unk> , they seemed an <unk> of bears from <unk> .
They had just landed from their boat , and this was the first house they entered .
No wonder , then , that they made a straight wake for the whale ’ s mouth — the bar — when the wrinkled little old Jonah , there <unk> , soon poured them out <unk> all round .
One <unk> of a bad cold in his head , upon which Jonah mixed him a <unk> <unk> of gin and <unk> , which he swore was a <unk> <unk> for all <unk> and <unk> whatsoever , never mind of how long standing , or whether caught off the coast of <unk> , or on the weather side of an <unk> .
The <unk> soon mounted into their heads , as it generally does even with the <unk> <unk> newly landed from sea , and they began <unk> about most <unk> .
I observed , however , that one of them held somewhat <unk> , and though he seemed <unk> not to spoil the <unk> of his shipmates by his own sober face , yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest .
This man <unk> me at once ; and since the <unk> had <unk> that he should soon become my shipmate ( though but a <unk> one , so far as this narrative is concerned ) , I will here venture upon a little description of him .
He stood full six feet in height , with noble shoulders , and a chest like a <unk> .
I have seldom seen such <unk> in a man .
His face was deeply brown and burnt , making his white teeth <unk> by the contrast ; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some <unk> that did not seem to give him much joy .
His voice at once announced that he was a <unk> , and from his fine <unk> , I thought he must be one of those tall <unk> from the <unk> <unk> in Virginia .
When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height , this man slipped away <unk> , and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea .
In a few minutes , however , he was <unk> by his shipmates , and being , it seems , for some reason a huge favourite with them , they raised a cry of “ Bulkington !
Bulkington !
where ’ s Bulkington ? ” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him .
It was now about nine o ’ clock , and the room seeming almost <unk> quiet after these <unk> , I began to <unk> myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen .
No man <unk> to sleep two in a bed .
In fact , you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother .
I don ’ t know how it is , but people like to be private when they are sleeping .
And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger , in a strange inn , in a strange town , and that stranger a harpooneer , then your <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed , more than anybody else ; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea , than <unk> Kings do ashore .
To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment , but you have your own hammock , and cover yourself with your own blanket , and sleep in your own skin .
The more I pondered over this harpooneer , the more I <unk> the thought of sleeping with him .
It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer , his linen or woollen , as the case might be , would not be of the <unk> , certainly none of the finest .
I began to <unk> all over .
Besides , it was getting late , and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going <unk> .
<unk> now , he should <unk> in upon me at midnight — how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming ?
“ Landlord !
I ’ ve changed my mind about that harpooneer . — I <unk> ’ t sleep with him .
I ’ ll try the bench here . ” “ Just as you please ; I ’ m sorry I can ’ t spare ye a <unk> for a <unk> , and it ’ s a <unk> rough board here ” — feeling of the <unk> and <unk> .
“ But wait a bit , <unk> ; I ’ ve got a carpenter ’ s plane there in the bar — wait , I say , and I ’ ll make ye snug enough . ” So saying he <unk> the plane ; and with his old <unk> handkerchief first <unk> the bench , vigorously set to <unk> away at my bed , the while grinning like an <unk> .
The shavings flew right and left ; till at last the <unk> came <unk> against an <unk> knot .
The landlord was near <unk> his wrist , and I told him for heaven ’ s sake to quit — the bed was soft enough to suit me , and I did not know how all the <unk> in the world could make <unk> down of a pine plank .
So <unk> up the shavings with another grin , and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room , he went about his business , and left me in a brown study .
I now took the measure of the bench , and found that it was a foot too short ; but that could be <unk> with a chair .
But it was a foot too narrow , and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the <unk> one — so there was no <unk> them .
I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall , leaving a little interval between , for my back to settle down in .
But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the <unk> of the window , that this plan would never do at all , especially as another <unk> from the <unk> door met the one from the window , and both together formed a series of small <unk> in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night .
The devil fetch that harpooneer , thought I , but stop , couldn ’ t I <unk> a march on him — bolt his door inside , and jump into his bed , not to be <unk> by the most violent <unk> ?
It seemed no bad idea ; but upon second thoughts I <unk> it .
For who could tell but what the next morning , so soon as I <unk> out of the room , the harpooneer might be standing in the entry , all ready to <unk> me down !
Still , looking round me again , and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person ’ s bed , I began to think that after all I might be <unk> <unk> <unk> against this unknown harpooneer .
Thinks I , I ’ ll wait awhile ; he must be dropping in before long .
I ’ ll have a good look at him then , and perhaps we may become jolly good <unk> after all — there ’ s no telling .
But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones , <unk> , and <unk> , and going to bed , yet no sign of my harpooneer .
“ Landlord ! ” said I , “ what sort of a chap is he — does he always keep such late hours ? ” It was now hard upon twelve o ’ clock .
The landlord <unk> again with his lean <unk> , and seemed to be <unk> <unk> at something beyond my <unk> .
“ No , ” he answered , “ generally he ’ s an early bird — <unk> to bed and <unk> to rise — yes , he ’ s the bird what <unk> the <unk> .
But to-night he went out a <unk> , you see , and I don ’ t see what on <unk> keeps him so late , unless , may be , he can ’ t sell his head . ” “ Can ’ t sell his head ? — What sort of a <unk> story is this you are telling me ? ” getting into a <unk> rage .
“ Do you pretend to say , landlord , that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday night , or rather Sunday morning , in <unk> his head around this town ? ” “ That ’ s precisely it , ” said the landlord , “ and I told him he couldn ’ t sell it here , the <unk> ’ s <unk> . ” “ With what ? ” shouted I.
“ With heads to be sure ; ain ’ t there too many heads in the world ? ” “ I tell you what it is , landlord , ” said I quite calmly , “ you ’ d better stop spinning that yarn to me — I ’ m not green . ” “ May be not , ” taking out a stick and <unk> a <unk> , “ but I <unk> guess you ’ ll be done _ brown _ if that ere harpooneer hears you a <unk> ’ his head . ” “ I ’ ll break it for him , ” said I , now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable <unk> of the landlord ’ s .
“ It ’ s broke a ’ ready , ” said he .
“ <unk> , ” said I — “ _ broke _ , do you mean ? ” “ <unk> , and that ’ s the very reason he can ’ t sell it , I guess . ” “ Landlord , ” said I , going up to him as cool as <unk> .
<unk> in a <unk> — “ landlord , stop <unk> .
You and I must understand one another , and that too without <unk> .
I come to your house and want a bed ; you tell me you can only give me half a one ; that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer .
And about this harpooneer , whom I have not yet seen , you <unk> in telling me the most <unk> and <unk> stories <unk> to beget in me an <unk> feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow — a sort of connexion , landlord , which is an <unk> and confidential one in the highest degree .
I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is , and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him .
And in the first place , you will be so good as to <unk> that story about <unk> his head , which if true I take to be good <unk> that this harpooneer is stark mad , and I ’ ve no idea of sleeping with a <unk> ; and you , sir , _ you _ I mean , landlord , _ you _ , sir , by trying to induce me to do so <unk> , would thereby render yourself <unk> to a <unk> <unk> . ” “ <unk> , ” said the landlord , fetching a long breath , “ that ’ s a <unk> long <unk> for a chap that <unk> a little now and then .
But be easy , be easy , this here harpooneer I have been <unk> ’ you of has just arrived from the south seas , where he <unk> up a lot of ’ <unk> New Zealand heads ( great <unk> , you know ) , and he ’ s <unk> all on ’ em but one , and that one he ’ s trying to sell to-night , cause to-morrow ’ s Sunday , and it would not do to be <unk> ’ human heads about the streets when <unk> is goin ’ to churches .
He wanted to , last Sunday , but I stopped him just as he was goin ’ out of the door with four heads <unk> on a string , for all the <unk> like a string of <unk> . ” This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery , and showed that the landlord , after all , had had no idea of <unk> me — but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath , engaged in such a cannibal business as <unk> the heads of dead <unk> ?
“ <unk> upon it , landlord , that harpooneer is a dangerous man . ” “ He <unk> <unk> ’ <unk> , ” was the <unk> .
“ But come , it ’ s getting dreadful late , you had better be turning flukes — it ’ s a <unk> bed ; <unk> and me slept in that ere bed the night we were <unk> .
There ’ s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed ; it ’ s an <unk> big bed that .
Why , afore we give it up , <unk> used to put our <unk> and little <unk> in the foot of it .
But I got a dreaming and <unk> about one night , and somehow , <unk> got pitched on the floor , and came near breaking his arm .
<unk> that , <unk> said it wouldn ’ t do .
Come along here , I ’ ll give ye a <unk> in a <unk> ; ” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me , offering to lead the way .
But I stood <unk> ; when looking at a clock in the corner , he exclaimed “ I <unk> it ’ s Sunday — you won ’ t see that harpooneer to-night ; he ’ s come to anchor somewhere — come along then ; _ do _ come ; _ won ’ t _ ye come ? ” I considered the matter a moment , and then up stairs we went , and I was <unk> into a small room , cold as a clam , and furnished , sure enough , with a prodigious bed , almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep <unk> .
“ There , ” said the landlord , placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a <unk> and centre table ; “ there , make yourself comfortable now , and good night to ye . ” I turned round from eyeing the bed , but he had disappeared .
<unk> back the counterpane , I stooped over the bed .
Though none of the most <unk> , it yet stood the <unk> <unk> well .
I then glanced round the room ; and besides the <unk> and centre table , could see no other furniture belonging to the place , but a rude shelf , the four walls , and a <unk> <unk> representing a man striking a whale .
Of things not properly belonging to the room , there was a hammock lashed up , and thrown upon the floor in one corner ; also a large seaman ’ s bag , containing the harpooneer ’ s <unk> , no doubt in lieu of a land trunk .
Likewise , there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the <unk> , and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed .
But what is this on the chest ?
I took it up , and held it close to the light , and felt it , and <unk> it , and tried every way possible to arrive at some <unk> conclusion concerning it .
I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat , <unk> at the <unk> with little <unk> <unk> something like the <unk> <unk> <unk> round an Indian <unk> .
There was a hole or <unk> in the middle of this mat , as you see the same in South American <unk> .
But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat , and <unk> the streets of any Christian town in that sort of <unk> ?
I put it on , to try it , and it <unk> me down like a <unk> , being uncommonly shaggy and thick , and I thought a little damp , as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a <unk> day .
I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall , and I never saw such a sight in my life .
I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a <unk> in the neck .
I sat down on the side of the bed , and commenced thinking about this <unk> harpooneer , and his door mat .
After thinking some time on the <unk> , I got up and took off my monkey jacket , and then stood in the middle of the room thinking .
I then took off my coat , and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves .
But beginning to feel very cold now , half <unk> as I was , and <unk> what the landlord said about the harpooneer ’ s not coming home at all that night , it being so very late , I made no more <unk> , but jumped out of my <unk> and boots , and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed , and <unk> myself to the care of heaven .
Whether that <unk> was stuffed with <unk> or broken <unk> , there is no telling , but I rolled about a good deal , and could not sleep for a long time .
At last I slid off into a light doze , and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of <unk> , when I heard a heavy <unk> in the passage , and saw a <unk> of light come into the room from under the door .
Lord save me , thinks I , that must be the harpooneer , the infernal <unk> .
But I lay perfectly still , and resolved not to say a word till spoken to .
<unk> a light in one hand , and that identical New Zealand head in the other , the stranger entered the room , and without looking towards the bed , placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner , and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room .
I was all eagerness to see his face , but he kept it <unk> for some time while employed in <unk> the bag ’ s mouth .
This accomplished , however , he turned round — when , good heavens !
what a sight !
Such a face !
It was of a dark , <unk> , yellow colour , here and there stuck over with large <unk> looking squares .
Yes , it ’ s just as I thought , he ’ s a terrible bedfellow ; he ’ s been in a fight , got <unk> cut , and here he is , just from the surgeon .
But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light , that I plainly saw they could not be <unk> at all , those black squares on his cheeks .
They were <unk> of some sort or other .
At first I knew not what to make of this ; but soon an <unk> of the truth occurred to me .
I remembered a story of a white man — a whaleman too — who , falling among the cannibals , had been tattooed by them .
I concluded that this harpooneer , in the course of his distant voyages , must have met with a similar adventure .
And what is it , thought I , after all !
It ’ s only his outside ; a man can be honest in any sort of skin .
But then , what to make of his unearthly complexion , that part of it , I mean , lying round about , and completely independent of the squares of tattooing .
To be sure , it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical <unk> ; but I never heard of a hot sun ’ s <unk> a white man into a <unk> yellow one .
However , I had never been in the South Seas ; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary <unk> upon the skin .
Now , while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning , this harpooneer never noticed me at all .
But , after some difficulty having opened his bag , he commenced <unk> in it , and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk , and a <unk> <unk> with the hair on .
<unk> these on the old chest in the middle of the room , he then took the New Zealand head — a ghastly thing enough — and <unk> it down into the bag .
He now took off his hat — a new beaver hat — when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise .
There was no hair on his head — none to speak of at least — nothing but a small <unk> twisted up on his forehead .
His <unk> <unk> head now looked for all the world like a <unk> skull .
Had not the stranger stood between me and the door , I would have bolted out of it <unk> than ever I bolted a dinner .
Even as it was , I thought something of slipping out of the window , but it was the second floor back .
I am no coward , but what to make of this <unk> purple rascal altogether passed my <unk> .
<unk> is the <unk> of fear , and being completely <unk> and confounded about the stranger , I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night .
In fact , I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him , and demand a <unk> answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him .
Meanwhile , he continued the business of <unk> , and at last showed his chest and arms .
As I live , these covered parts of him were <unk> with the same squares as his face ; his back , too , was all over the same dark squares ; he seemed to have been in a <unk> <unk> ’ <unk> , and just escaped from it with a <unk> shirt .
Still more , his very legs were marked , as if a parcel of dark green <unk> were running up the <unk> of young palms .
It was now quite plain that he must be some <unk> savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas , and so landed in this Christian country .
I <unk> to think of it .
A <unk> of heads too — perhaps the heads of his own <unk> .
He might take a fancy to mine — heavens !
look at that tomahawk !
But there was no time for shuddering , for now the savage went about something that completely <unk> my attention , and convinced me that he must indeed be a <unk> .
Going to his heavy <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , which he had previously hung on a chair , he <unk> in the pockets , and produced at length a curious little <unk> image with a <unk> on its back , and exactly the colour of a three days ’ old <unk> baby .
<unk> the embalmed head , at first I almost thought that this black <unk> was a real baby preserved in some similar manner .
But seeing that it was not at all limber , and that it <unk> a good deal like polished <unk> , I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol , which indeed it proved to be .
For now the savage goes up to the empty <unk> , and removing the <unk> <unk> , sets up this little <unk> image , like a <unk> , between the <unk> .
The chimney <unk> and all the <unk> inside were very <unk> , so that I thought this <unk> made a very <unk> little <unk> or chapel for his <unk> idol .
I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image , feeling but ill at ease <unk> — to see what was next to follow .
First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his <unk> pocket , and places them carefully before the idol ; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and <unk> the flame from the lamp , he <unk> the shavings into a <unk> <unk> .
Presently , after many <unk> <unk> into the fire , and still <unk> <unk> of his fingers ( whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly ) , he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit ; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little , he made a polite offer of it to the little negro .
But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all ; he never moved his lips .
All these strange <unk> were accompanied by still stranger <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , who seemed to be <unk> in a <unk> or else singing some pagan <unk> or other , during which his face <unk> about in the most unnatural manner .
At last <unk> the fire , he took the idol up very <unk> , and <unk> it again in his <unk> pocket as <unk> as if he were a <unk> <unk> a dead <unk> .
All these queer proceedings increased my <unk> , and seeing him now <unk> strong symptoms of concluding his business <unk> , and <unk> into bed with me , I thought it was high time , now or never , before the light was put out , to break the spell in which I had so long been bound .
But the interval I spent in <unk> what to say , was a fatal one .
<unk> up his tomahawk from the table , he <unk> the head of it for an instant , and then holding it to the light , with his mouth at the handle , he <unk> out great clouds of tobacco smoke .
The next moment the light was <unk> , and this wild cannibal , tomahawk between his teeth , sprang into bed with me .
I <unk> out , I could not help it now ; and giving a sudden <unk> of astonishment he began feeling me .
<unk> out something , I knew not what , I rolled away from him against the wall , and then <unk> him , whoever or whatever he might be , to keep quiet , and let me get up and light the lamp again .
But his <unk> <unk> satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning .
“ <unk> <unk> you ? ” — he at last said — “ you no <unk> , <unk> , I kill-e . ” And so saying the lighted tomahawk began <unk> about me in the dark .
“ Landlord , for God ’ s sake , Peter Coffin ! ” shouted I.
“ Landlord !
Watch !
Coffin !
<unk> !
save me ! ” “ <unk> !
<unk> me <unk> be , or <unk> , I kill-e ! ” again <unk> the cannibal , while his horrid <unk> of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire .
But thank heaven , at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand , and leaping from the bed I ran up to him .
“ Don ’ t be afraid now , ” said he , grinning again , “ Queequeg here wouldn ’ t harm a hair of your head . ” “ Stop your grinning , ” shouted I , “ and why didn ’ t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal ? ” “ I thought ye know ’ d it ; — didn ’ t I tell ye , he was a <unk> ’ heads around town ? — but turn flukes again and go to sleep .
Queequeg , look here — you sabbee me , I sabbee — you this man <unk> you — you sabbee ? ” “ <unk> sabbee plenty ” — <unk> Queequeg , puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed .
“ You <unk> in , ” he added , <unk> to me with his tomahawk , and throwing the clothes to one side .
He really did this in not only a <unk> but a really kind and charitable way .
