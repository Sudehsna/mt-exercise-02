But still driving on in the wake of the whales , at length they seemed <unk> their speed ; gradually the ship neared them ; and the wind now dying away , word was passed to spring to the boats .
But no sooner did the herd , by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale , become <unk> of the three keels that were after them , — though as yet a mile in their rear , — than they <unk> again , and forming in close <unk> and <unk> , so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of <unk> <unk> , moved on with <unk> velocity .
<unk> to our <unk> and drawers , we sprang to the <unk> , and after several hours ’ pulling were almost <unk> to <unk> the chase , when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave <unk> token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which , when the fishermen perceive it in the whale , they say he is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming , were now broken up in one measureless <unk> ; and like King <unk> ’ elephants in the Indian battle with <unk> , they seemed going mad with consternation .
In all directions <unk> in vast irregular circles , and <unk> swimming hither and thither , by their short thick spoutings , they plainly betrayed their <unk> of panic .
This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number , who , completely <unk> as it were , <unk> floated like <unk> <unk> ships on the sea .
Had these Leviathans been but a <unk> of simple <unk> , pursued over the pasture by three fierce <unk> , they could not possibly have evinced such <unk> dismay .
But this occasional <unk> is <unk> of almost all <unk> creatures .
Though <unk> together in <unk> of thousands , the <unk> <unk> of the West have fled before a solitary <unk> .
<unk> , too , all human beings , how when <unk> together in the <unk> of a <unk> ’ s pit , they will , at the slightest alarm of fire , rush <unk> for the <unk> , crowding , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> dashing each other to death .
<unk> , therefore , <unk> any amazement at the strangely <unk> whales before us , for there is no <unk> of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely <unk> by the madness of men .
Though many of the whales , as has been said , were in violent motion , yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated , but <unk> remained in one place .
As is customary in those cases , the boats at once separated , each making for some one lone whale on the <unk> of the shoal .
In about three minutes ’ time , Queequeg ’ s harpoon was flung ; the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces , and then running away with us like light , steered straight for the heart of the herd .
Though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances , is in no wise <unk> ; and indeed is almost always more or less <unk> ; yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery .
For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal , you bid <unk> to <unk> life and only <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
As , blind and <unk> , the whale plunged forward , as if by <unk> power of speed to rid himself of the iron <unk> that had fastened to him ; as we thus tore a white <unk> in the sea , on all sides <unk> as we flew , by the <unk> creatures to and fro rushing about us ; our <unk> boat was like a ship <unk> by <unk> in a tempest , and striving to steer through their complicated <unk> and straits , knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed .
But not a bit <unk> , Queequeg steered us <unk> ; now <unk> off from this monster directly across our <unk> in advance ; now <unk> away from that , whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead , while all the time , Starbuck stood up in the bows , lance in hand , <unk> out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts , for there was no time to make long ones .
Nor were the oarsmen quite <unk> , though their <unk> duty was now altogether <unk> with .
They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business .
“ Out of the way , Commodore ! ” cried one , to a great <unk> that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface , and for an instant threatened to <unk> us .
“ <unk> down with your tail , there ! ” cried a second to another , which , close to our gunwale , seemed calmly <unk> himself with his own <unk> extremity .
All <unk> carry certain curious contrivances , originally <unk> by the Nantucket Indians , called <unk> .
Two thick squares of wood of equal size are <unk> clenched together , so that they cross each other ’ s <unk> at right <unk> ; a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block , and the other end of the line being <unk> , it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon .
It is chiefly among <unk> whales that this <unk> is used .
For then , more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time .
But sperm whales are not every day encountered ; while you may , then , you must kill all you can .
And if you cannot kill them all at once , you must wing them , so that they can be afterwards killed at your <unk> .
Hence it is , that at times like these the <unk> , comes into <unk> .
Our boat was furnished with three of them .
The first and second were <unk> darted , and we saw the whales <unk> running off , <unk> by the enormous sidelong <unk> of the towing <unk> .
They were <unk> like <unk> with the <unk> and ball .
But upon flinging the third , in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block , it caught under one of the <unk> of the boat , and in an instant tore it out and carried it away , dropping the oarsman in the boat ’ s bottom as the seat slid from under him .
On both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks , but we stuffed two or three drawers and <unk> in , and so stopped the <unk> for the time .
It had been next to impossible to dart these <unk> , were it not that as we advanced into the herd , our whale ’ s way greatly diminished ; moreover , that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion , the direful <unk> seemed <unk> .
So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out , and the towing whale sideways <unk> ; then , with the tapering force of his <unk> <unk> , we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal , as if from some mountain <unk> we had slid into a serene valley lake .
Here the storms in the roaring <unk> between the <unk> whales , were heard but not felt .
In this central <unk> the sea presented that smooth <unk> surface , called a <unk> , produced by the subtle <unk> thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods .
Yes , we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion .
And still in the distracted distance we beheld the <unk> of the outer <unk> circles , and saw successive <unk> of whales , eight or ten in each , swiftly going round and round , like <unk> <unk> of horses in a ring ; and so closely shoulder to shoulder , that a <unk> <unk> might easily have <unk> the middle ones , and so have gone round on their backs .
<unk> to the <unk> of the crowd of <unk> whales , more immediately surrounding the <unk> axis of the herd , no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us .
We must watch for a <unk> in the living wall that <unk> us in ; the wall that had only <unk> us in order to shut us up .
<unk> at the centre of the lake , we were occasionally visited by small tame <unk> and calves ; the women and children of this <unk> host .
Now , <unk> of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles , and <unk> of the spaces between the various <unk> in any one of those circles , the entire area at this juncture , embraced by the whole multitude , must have contained at least two or three square miles .
At any rate — though indeed such a test at such a time might be <unk> — spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the <unk> of the horizon .
I mention this circumstance , because , as if the <unk> and calves had been <unk> locked up in this innermost <unk> ; and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto <unk> them from learning the precise cause of its stopping ; or , possibly , being so young , <unk> , and every way innocent and <unk> ; however it may have been , these smaller whales — now and then <unk> our <unk> boat from the margin of the lake — evinced a wondrous <unk> and confidence , or else a still <unk> panic which it was impossible not to <unk> at .
Like household dogs they came <unk> round us , right up to our gunwales , and touching them ; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly <unk> them .
Queequeg <unk> their <unk> ; Starbuck <unk> their backs with his lance ; but fearful of the <unk> , for the time refrained from darting it .
But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface , another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side .
For , suspended in those watery <unk> , floated the forms of the <unk> mothers of the whales , and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers .
The lake , as I have hinted , was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent ; and as human infants while <unk> will calmly and <unk> gaze away from the breast , as if leading two different lives at the time ; and while yet drawing mortal <unk> , be still <unk> <unk> upon some unearthly <unk> ; — even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us , but not at us , as if we were but a bit of <unk> in their <unk> sight .
<unk> on their sides , the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us .
One of these little infants , that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old , might have measured some <unk> feet in length , and some six feet in girth .
He was a little <unk> ; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that <unk> position it had so <unk> occupied in the maternal <unk> ; where , tail to head , and all ready for the final spring , the <unk> whale lies bent like a Tartar ’ s bow .
The delicate <unk> , and the palms of his flukes , still <unk> retained the <unk> <unk> appearance of a baby ’ s ears newly arrived from foreign parts .
“ Line !
line ! ” cried Queequeg , looking over the gunwale ; “ him fast !
him fast ! — Who line him !
Who struck ? — Two whale ; one big , one little ! ” “ What <unk> ye , man ? ” cried Starbuck .
“ <unk> here , ” said Queequeg , pointing down .
As when the stricken whale , that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope ; as , after deep sounding , he floats up again , and shows the slackened curling line <unk> rising and <unk> towards the air ; so now , Starbuck saw long coils of the <unk> cord of <unk> Leviathan , by which the young <unk> seemed still <unk> to its dam .
Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase , this natural line , with the maternal end loose , becomes entangled with the hempen one , so that the <unk> is thereby <unk> .
Some of the <unk> secrets of the seas seemed <unk> to us in this enchanted <unk> .
We saw young Leviathan <unk> in the deep .
* * The sperm whale , as with all other species of the Leviathan , but unlike most other fish , <unk> <unk> at all seasons ; after a <unk> which may probably be set down at nine months , producing but one at a time ; though in some few known instances giving birth to an <unk> and <unk> : — a <unk> provided for in <unk> by two <unk> , curiously <unk> , one on each side of the <unk> ; but the <unk> themselves <unk> upwards from that .
When by chance these precious parts in a <unk> whale are cut by the hunter ’ s lance , the mother ’ s <unk> milk and blood <unk> <unk> the sea for rods .
The milk is very sweet and rich ; it has been <unk> by man ; it might do well with <unk> .
When <unk> with mutual <unk> , the whales <unk> _ more <unk> _ .
And thus , though surrounded by circle upon circle of <unk> and <unk> , did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and <unk> <unk> in all peaceful <unk> ; yea , <unk> <unk> in <unk> and delight .
But even so , amid the <unk> Atlantic of my being , do I myself still for ever <unk> <unk> in <unk> calm ; and while ponderous <unk> of <unk> woe <unk> round me , deep down and deep inland there I still <unk> me in eternal mildness of joy .
Meanwhile , as we thus lay <unk> , the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats , still engaged in <unk> the whales on the <unk> of the host ; or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle , where abundance of room and some convenient <unk> were afforded them .
But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles , was nothing to what at last met our eyes .
It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly <unk> and <unk> , to seek to <unk> him , as it were , by <unk> or <unk> his gigantic <unk> .
It is done by darting a <unk> cutting-spade , to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again .
A whale wounded ( as we afterwards learned ) in this part , but not <unk> , as it seemed , had broken away from the boat , carrying along with him half of the harpoon line ; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound , he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted <unk> <unk> , at the battle of <unk> , carrying dismay wherever he went .
But <unk> as was the wound of this whale , and an appalling spectacle enough , any way ; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to <unk> the rest of the herd , was owing to a cause which at first the <unk> distance <unk> from us .
But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery , this whale had become entangled in the <unk> that he towed ; he had also run away with the cutting-spade in him ; and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon , had <unk> caught in the coils of the <unk> round his tail , the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh .
So that tormented to madness , he was now churning through the water , violently <unk> with his <unk> tail , and tossing the keen spade about him , <unk> and <unk> his own comrades .
This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright .
First , the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little , and <unk> against each other , as if lifted by half spent billows from afar ; then the lake itself began <unk> to heave and swell ; the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ; in more and more <unk> <unk> the whales in the more central circles began to swim in <unk> <unk> .
Yes , the long calm was <unk> .
A low advancing hum was soon heard ; and then like to the tumultuous masses of <unk> when the great river <unk> breaks up in Spring , the entire host of whales came <unk> upon their inner centre , as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain .
Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places ; Starbuck taking the stern .
“ <unk> !
<unk> ! ” he <unk> whispered , seizing the helm — “ <unk> your oars , and clutch your souls , now !
My God , men , stand by !
<unk> him off , you Queequeg — the whale there ! — prick him ! — hit him !
Stand up — stand up , and stay so !
Spring , men — pull , men ; never mind their backs — scrape them ! — scrape away ! ” The boat was now all but <unk> between two vast black <unk> , leaving a narrow <unk> between their long <unk> .
But by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening ; then giving way rapidly , and at the same time earnestly watching for another <unk> .
After many similar <unk> <unk> , we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles , but now crossed by random whales , all violently making for one centre .
This lucky salvation was <unk> <unk> by the loss of Queequeg ’ s hat , who , while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales , had his hat taken clean from his head by the <unk> made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by .
<unk> and disordered as the universal commotion now was , it soon resolved itself into what seemed a <unk> movement ; for having <unk> together at last in one dense body , they then <unk> their <unk> flight with <unk> <unk> .
<unk> pursuit was useless ; but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern , and likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and <unk> .
The waif is a <unk> pole , two or three of which are carried by every boat ; and which , when additional game is at hand , are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale , both to mark its place on the sea , and also as token of prior possession , should the boats of any other ship draw near .
The result of this lowering was somewhat <unk> of that sagacious saying in the Fishery , — the more whales the less fish .
Of all the drugged whales only one was captured .
The rest <unk> to escape for the time , but only to be taken , as will hereafter be seen , by some other craft than the Pequod .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> .
The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm Whales , and there was also then given the probable cause <unk> those vast <unk> .
Now , though such great bodies are at times encountered , yet , as must have been seen , even at the present day , small detached <unk> are occasionally observed , <unk> from twenty to fifty <unk> each .
Such <unk> are known as schools .
They generally are of two sorts ; those <unk> almost entirely of <unk> , and those <unk> none but young vigorous <unk> , or <unk> , as they are familiarly designated .
In <unk> <unk> upon the school of <unk> , you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude , but not old ; who , upon any alarm , <unk> his <unk> by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies .
In truth , this gentleman is a <unk> <unk> , swimming about over the watery world , <unk> accompanied by all the <unk> and <unk> of the harem .
The contrast between this <unk> and his <unk> is striking ; because , while he is always of the largest leviathanic <unk> , the ladies , even at full <unk> , are not more than <unk> of the bulk of an <unk> male .
They are comparatively delicate , indeed ; I dare say , not to exceed half a <unk> yards round the waist .
Nevertheless , it cannot be <unk> , that upon the whole they are <unk> entitled to _ <unk> <unk> point _ .
It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent <unk> .
Like <unk> , they are for ever on the move in <unk> search of variety .
You meet them on the Line in time for the full <unk> of the <unk> feeding season , having just returned , perhaps , from spending the summer in the Northern seas , and so <unk> summer of all <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
By the time they have <unk> up and down the <unk> of the Equator awhile , they start for the Oriental waters in <unk> of the cool season there , and so <unk> the other <unk> <unk> of the year .
When <unk> advancing on one of these <unk> , if any strange suspicious sights are seen , my lord whale keeps a <unk> eye on his interesting family .
<unk> any <unk> <unk> young Leviathan coming that way , presume to draw <unk> close to one of the ladies , with what prodigious fury the <unk> <unk> him , and <unk> him away !
High times , indeed , if <unk> young <unk> like him are to be permitted to <unk> the <unk> of domestic <unk> ; though do what the <unk> will , he cannot keep the most <unk> <unk> out of his bed ; for , alas !
all fish bed in common .
As ashore , the ladies often cause the most terrible <unk> among their <unk> <unk> ; just so with the whales , who sometimes come to deadly battle , and all for love .
They <unk> with their long lower jaws , sometimes <unk> them together , and so striving for the <unk> like <unk> that <unk> <unk> their <unk> .
Not a few are captured having the deep <unk> of these <unk> , — <unk> heads , broken teeth , <unk> fins ; and in some instances , wrenched and <unk> mouths .
But <unk> the <unk> of domestic <unk> to <unk> himself away at the first rush of the harem ’ s lord , then is it very <unk> to watch that lord .
<unk> he <unk> his vast bulk among them again and <unk> there awhile , still in <unk> vicinity to young <unk> , like pious Solomon <unk> worshipping among his thousand <unk> .
<unk> other whales to be in sight , the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these Grand <unk> ; for these Grand <unk> are too <unk> of their strength , and hence their <unk> is small .
As for the sons and the daughters they beget , why , those sons and daughters must take care of themselves ; at least , with only the maternal help .
For like certain other <unk> <unk> <unk> that might be named , my Lord Whale has no taste for the <unk> , however much for the <unk> ; and so , being a great traveller , he leaves his <unk> <unk> all over the world ; every baby an <unk> .
In good time , nevertheless , as the <unk> of youth <unk> ; as years and <unk> <unk> ; as reflection <unk> her solemn <unk> ; in short , as a general <unk> <unk> the <unk> Turk ; then a love of ease and virtue <unk> the love for <unk> ; our <unk> enters upon the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stage of life , <unk> , <unk> the harem , and grown to an <unk> , <unk> old soul , goes about all alone among the meridians and <unk> saying his prayers , and warning each young Leviathan from his <unk> <unk> .
Now , as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school , so is the lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster .
It is therefore not in <unk> character , however <unk> <unk> , that after going to school himself , he should then go abroad <unk> not what he learned there , but the <unk> of it .
His title , schoolmaster , would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself , but some have <unk> that the man who first thus entitled this sort of <unk> whale , must have read the <unk> of <unk> , and informed himself what sort of a <unk> that famous Frenchman was in his <unk> days , and what was the nature of those <unk> <unk> he <unk> into some of his <unk> .
The same <unk> and <unk> to which the schoolmaster whale <unk> himself in his advancing years , is true of all aged Sperm Whales .
Almost <unk> , a lone whale — as a solitary Leviathan is called — <unk> an ancient one .
Like venerable <unk> <unk> <unk> , he will have no one near him but Nature herself ; and her he takes to wife in the <unk> of waters , and the best of wives she is , though she keeps so many moody secrets .
The schools <unk> none but young and vigorous <unk> , previously mentioned , offer a strong contrast to the harem schools .
For while those <unk> whales are <unk> timid , the young <unk> , or <unk> , as they call them , are by far the most <unk> of all Leviathans , and <unk> the most dangerous to encounter ; <unk> those wondrous <unk> , <unk> whales , sometimes met , and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> schools are larger than the harem schools .
Like a mob of young <unk> , they are full of fight , fun , and <unk> , <unk> round the world at such a reckless , <unk> rate , that no prudent <unk> would <unk> them any more than he would a <unk> lad at <unk> or <unk> .
They soon <unk> this <unk> though , and when about <unk> grown , break up , and separately go about in quest of <unk> , that is , <unk> .
Another point of difference between the male and <unk> schools is still more <unk> of the <unk> .
Say you strike a <unk> — poor devil !
all his comrades quit him .
But strike a member of the harem school , and her companions swim around her with every token of concern , sometimes lingering so near her and so long , as themselves to fall a prey .
CHAPTER <unk> .
Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish .
The allusion to the waif and <unk> in the last chapter but one , <unk> some account of the laws and <unk> of the whale fishery , of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and <unk> .
It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company , a whale may be struck by one vessel , then escape , and be finally killed and captured by another vessel ; and <unk> are indirectly <unk> many <unk> <unk> , all <unk> of this one grand feature .
For example , — after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale , the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm ; and <unk> far away to leeward , be <unk> by a second whaler , who , in a calm , snugly <unk> it alongside , without risk of life or line .
Thus the most <unk> and violent <unk> would often <unk> between the fishermen , were there not some written or <unk> , universal , <unk> law applicable to all cases .
Perhaps the only <unk> whaling <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> , was that of Holland .
It was <unk> by the <unk> in A.D. <unk> .
But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law , yet the American fishermen have been their own <unk> and <unk> in this matter .
They have provided a system which for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ’ s <unk> and the <unk> of the Chinese <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> with other People ’ s <unk> .
Yes ; these laws might be <unk> on a Queen <unk> ’ s <unk> , or the barb of a harpoon , and worn round the neck , so small are they .
I.
A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it .
II .
A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can <unk> catch it .
But what <unk> the <unk> with this <unk> <unk> is the admirable <unk> of it , which <unk> a vast volume of <unk> to <unk> it .
First : What is a Fast-Fish ?
<unk> or dead a fish is technically fast , when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat , by any medium at all <unk> by the <unk> or <unk> , — a mast , an oar , a <unk> cable , a <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> of <unk> , it is all the same .
Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif , or any other recognised symbol of possession ; so long as the party <unk> it plainly <unk> their <unk> at any time to take it alongside , as well as their intention so to do .
These are scientific <unk> ; but the <unk> of the whalemen themselves sometimes <unk> in hard words and <unk> <unk> — the <unk> of the <unk> .
True , among the more upright and honorable whalemen <unk> are always made for peculiar cases , where it would be an <unk> <unk> <unk> for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party .
But others are by no means so <unk> .
Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of <unk> <unk> in England , wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas ; and when indeed they ( the plaintiffs ) had succeeded in <unk> the fish ; they were at last , through peril of their lives , obliged to <unk> not only their lines , but their boat itself .
<unk> the defendants ( the crew of another ship ) came up with the whale , struck , killed , seized , and finally <unk> it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs .
And when those defendants were <unk> with , their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs ’ teeth , and assured them that by way of <unk> to the deed he had done , he would now retain their line , harpoons , and boat , which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the <unk> .
Wherefore the plaintiffs now <unk> for the <unk> of the value of their whale , line , harpoons , and boat .
Mr. <unk> was <unk> for the defendants ; Lord <unk> was the judge .
In the course of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> went on to <unk> his position , by <unk> to a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> .
case , wherein a gentleman , after in vain trying to <unk> his wife ’ s <unk> , had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life ; but in the course of years , <unk> of that step , he <unk> an action to <unk> possession of her .
<unk> was on the other side ; and he then <unk> it by saying , that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady , and had once had her fast , and only by reason of the great <unk> of her plunging <unk> , had at last abandoned her ; yet <unk> her he did , so that she became a <unk> ; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman <unk> her , the lady then became that subsequent gentleman ’ s property , along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her .
Now in the present case <unk> <unk> that the <unk> of the whale and the lady were <unk> <unk> of each other .
These <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , being duly heard , the very learned judge in set terms decided , to <unk> , — That as for the boat , he <unk> it to the plaintiffs , because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives ; but that with regard to the <unk> whale , harpoons , and line , they belonged to the defendants ; the whale , because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture ; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them , it ( the fish ) <unk> a property in those articles ; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them .
Now the defendants afterwards took the fish ; <unk> , the <unk> articles were theirs .
A common man looking at this <unk> of the very learned <unk> , might possibly object to it .
But <unk> up to the <unk> rock of the matter , the two great principles laid down in the <unk> whaling laws previously <unk> , and applied and <unk> by Lord <unk> in the above <unk> case ; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish , I say , will , on reflection , be found the <unk> of all human <unk> ; for notwithstanding its complicated <unk> of <unk> , the Temple of the <unk> , like the Temple of the <unk> , has but two <unk> to stand on .
Is it not a saying in every one ’ s mouth , <unk> is half of the law : that is , <unk> of how the thing came into possession ?
But often possession is the whole of the law .
What are the <unk> and souls of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but Fast-Fish , <unk> possession is the whole of the law ?
What to the <unk> landlord is the widow ’ s last <unk> but a Fast-Fish ?
What is yonder <unk> <unk> ’ s marble <unk> with a <unk> for a waif ; what is that but a Fast-Fish ?
What is the <unk> <unk> which <unk> , the <unk> , gets from poor <unk> , the <unk> , on a <unk> to keep <unk> ’ s family from <unk> ; what is that <unk> <unk> but a Fast-Fish ?
What is the <unk> of <unk> ’ s <unk> of £ <unk> seized from the <unk> bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of <unk> laborers ( all sure of heaven without any of <unk> ’ s help ) what is that globular £ <unk> but a Fast-Fish ?
What are the Duke of <unk> ’ s hereditary towns and <unk> but Fast-Fish ?
What to that <unk> harpooneer , John <unk> , is poor <unk> , but a Fast-Fish ?
What to that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , is <unk> but a Fast-Fish ?
And concerning all these , is not <unk> the whole of the law ?
But if the <unk> of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable , the kindred <unk> of Loose-Fish is still more widely so .
That is <unk> and <unk> applicable .
What was America in <unk> but a Loose-Fish , in which <unk> struck the Spanish <unk> by way of <unk> it for his royal master and <unk> ?
What was <unk> to the Czar ?
What <unk> to the Turk ?
What India to England ?
What at last will <unk> be to the United States ?
All Loose-Fish .
What are the <unk> of Man and the <unk> of the <unk> but Loose-Fish ?
What all men ’ s minds and <unk> but Loose-Fish ?
What is the principle of <unk> belief in them but a Loose-Fish ?
What to the <unk> <unk> <unk> are the thoughts of <unk> but Loose-Fish ?
What is the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish ?
And what are you , reader , but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish , too ?
CHAPTER 90 .
<unk> or <unk> .
“ De <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> . ” _ <unk> , <unk> . 3 , <unk> . 3 . _ Latin from the books of the <unk> of England , which taken along with the <unk> , means , that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land , the King , as <unk> Grand <unk> , must have the head , and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail .
A <unk> which , in the whale , is much like <unk> an <unk> ; there is no <unk> <unk> .
Now as this law , under a modified form , is to this day in force in England ; and as it <unk> in various respects a strange <unk> touching the general law of <unk> and Loose-Fish , it is here treated of in a separate chapter , on the same <unk> principle that <unk> the English <unk> to be at the expense of a separate <unk> , specially reserved for the <unk> of royalty .
In the first place , in curious <unk> of the fact that the <unk> law is still in force , I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two years .
It seems that some honest mariners of <unk> , or <unk> , or some one of the <unk> <unk> , had after a hard chase succeeded in <unk> and <unk> a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore .
Now the <unk> <unk> are <unk> or somehow under the <unk> of a sort of <unk> or <unk> , called a Lord <unk> .
<unk> the office directly from the crown , I believe , all the royal <unk> incident to the <unk> <unk> <unk> become by <unk> his .
By some <unk> this office is called a <unk> .
But not so .
Because the Lord <unk> is <unk> employed at times in <unk> his <unk> ; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same <unk> of them .
Now when these poor <unk> mariners , <unk> , and with their trowsers rolled high up on their <unk> legs , had <unk> hauled their fat fish high and dry , promising themselves a good £ <unk> from the precious oil and bone ; and in <unk> <unk> rare tea with their wives , and good ale with their <unk> , upon the strength of their respective <unk> ; up steps a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman , with a copy of <unk> under his arm ; and laying it upon the whale ’ s head , he says — “ Hands off !
this fish , my <unk> , is a Fast-Fish .
I seize it as the Lord <unk> ’ s . ” Upon this the poor mariners in their <unk> consternation — so truly English — knowing not what to say , fall to vigorously <unk> their heads all round ; meanwhile <unk> glancing from the whale to the stranger .
But that did in <unk> mend the matter , or at all <unk> the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of <unk> .
At length one of them , after long <unk> about for his ideas , made bold to speak , “ <unk> , sir , who is the Lord <unk> ? ” “ The Duke . ” “ But the <unk> had nothing to do with taking this fish ? ” “ It is his . ” “ We have been at great trouble , and peril , and some expense , and is all that to go to the Duke ’ s <unk> ; we getting nothing at all for our pains but our <unk> ? ” “ It is his . ” “ Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate <unk> of getting a <unk> ? ” “ It is his . ” “ I thought to <unk> my old <unk> mother by part of my share of this whale . ” “ It is his . ” “ <unk> ’ t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half ? ” “ It is his . ” In a word , the whale was seized and <unk> , and his Grace the Duke of <unk> received the money .
<unk> that viewed in some particular lights , the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed , under the circumstances , a rather hard one , an honest <unk> of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace , <unk> him to take the case of those <unk> mariners into full consideration .
To which my Lord Duke in substance replied ( both letters were published ) that he had already done so , and received the money , and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he ( the reverend gentleman ) would <unk> <unk> with other people ’ s business .
Is this the still <unk> old man , standing at the corners of the three <unk> , on all hands <unk> <unk> of <unk> ?
It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to the whale was a <unk> one from the <unk> .
We must needs <unk> then on what principle the <unk> is originally invested with that right .
The law itself has already been set forth .
But <unk> gives us the reason for it .
<unk> <unk> , the whale so caught belongs to the King and Queen , “ because of its superior <unk> . ” And by the <unk> <unk> this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters .
But why should the King have the head , and the Queen the tail ?
A reason for that , ye <unk> !
In his <unk> on “ <unk> , ” or <unk> , an old King ’ s <unk> author , one William <unk> , thus <unk> : “ Ye tail is ye Queen ’ s , that ye Queen ’ s <unk> may be supplied with ye whalebone . ” Now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies ’ <unk> .
But this same bone is not in the tail ; it is in the head , which is a sad mistake for a sagacious <unk> like <unk> .
But is the Queen a <unk> , to be presented with a tail ?
An <unk> meaning may lurk here .
There are two royal fish so <unk> by the English law <unk> — the whale and the <unk> ; both royal property under certain <unk> , and <unk> <unk> the tenth branch of the crown ’ s ordinary <unk> .
I know not that any other author has hinted of the matter ; but by inference it seems to me that the <unk> must be divided in the same way as the whale , the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish , which , <unk> regarded , may possibly be humorously <unk> upon some presumed <unk> .
And thus there seems a reason in all things , even in law .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Pequod Meets The <unk> .
“ In vain it was to <unk> for <unk> in the <unk> of this Leviathan , insufferable <unk> <unk> not inquiry . ” _ Sir T. Browne , <unk> _ It was a week or two after the last whaling scene <unk> , and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy , vapory , <unk> sea , that the many noses on the Pequod ’ s deck proved more <unk> <unk> than the three <unk> of eyes aloft .
A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was <unk> in the sea .
“ I will <unk> something now , ” said Stubb , “ that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we <unk> the other day .
I thought they would keel up before long . ” Presently , the vapors in advance slid aside ; and there in the distance lay a ship , whose <unk> sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside .
As we glided nearer , the stranger showed French colours from his <unk> ; and by the eddying <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> , and hovered , and <unk> around him , it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale , that is , a whale that has died <unk> on the sea , and so floated an <unk> corpse .
It may well be <unk> , what an <unk> odor such a mass must <unk> ; worse than an <unk> city in the plague , when the living are <unk> to bury the departed .
So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some , that no <unk> could <unk> them to <unk> alongside of it .
Yet are there those who will still do it ; notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality , and by no means of the nature of <unk> .
Coming still nearer with the <unk> breeze , we saw that the Frenchman had a second whale alongside ; and this second whale seemed even more of a <unk> than the first .
In truth , it turned out to be one of those <unk> whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia , or <unk> ; leaving their <unk> bodies almost entirely <unk> of anything like oil .
Nevertheless , in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this , however much he may <unk> blasted whales in general .
The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger , that Stubb <unk> he recognised his cutting <unk> entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales .
“ There ’ s a pretty fellow , now , ” he <unk> laughed , standing in the ship ’ s bows , “ there ’ s a <unk> for ye !
I well know that these <unk> of <unk> are but poor devils in the fishery ; sometimes lowering their boats for breakers , <unk> them for Sperm Whale spouts ; yes , and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of <unk> candles , and cases of <unk> , <unk> that all the oil they will get won ’ t be enough to dip the Captain ’ s <unk> into ; aye , we all know these things ; but look ye , here ’ s a <unk> that is content with our <unk> , the drugged whale there , I mean ; aye , and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there .
Poor devil !
I say , pass round a hat , some one , and let ’ s make him a present of a little oil for dear <unk> ’ s sake .
For what oil he ’ ll get from that drugged whale there , wouldn ’ t be fit to burn in a <unk> ; no , not in a condemned <unk> .
And as for the other whale , why , I ’ ll agree to get more oil by <unk> up and trying out these three masts of ours , than he ’ ll get from that <unk> of bones ; though , now that I think of it , it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil ; yes , ambergris .
I wonder now if our old man has thought of that .
It ’ s worth trying .
Yes , I ’ m for it ; ” and so saying he started for the quarter-deck .
By this time the faint air had become a complete calm ; so that whether or no , the Pequod was now fairly <unk> in the smell , with no hope of <unk> except by its <unk> up again .
<unk> from the cabin , Stubb now called his boat ’ s crew , and pulled off for the stranger .
<unk> across her bow , he perceived that in accordance with the <unk> French taste , the upper part of her <unk> was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping <unk> , was painted green , and for <unk> had copper <unk> projecting from it here and there ; the whole <unk> in a <unk> folded <unk> of a bright red colour .
Upon her head <unk> , in large <unk> letters , he read “ <unk> de <unk> , ” — <unk> , or <unk> ; and this was the romantic name of this <unk> ship .
Though Stubb did not understand the _ <unk> _ part of the <unk> , yet the word _ rose _ , and the <unk> <unk> put together , sufficiently explained the whole to him .
“ A wooden <unk> , eh ? ” he cried with his hand to his nose , “ that will do very well ; but how like all creation it smells ! ” Now in order to hold direct <unk> with the people on deck , he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side , and thus come close to the blasted whale ; and so talk over it .
<unk> then at this spot , with one hand still to his nose , he <unk> — “ <unk> , ahoy !
are there any of you <unk> that speak English ? ” “ Yes , ” <unk> a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks , who turned out to be the chief-mate .
“ Well , then , my <unk> , have you seen the White Whale ? ” “ _ What _ whale ? ” “ The _ White _ Whale — a Sperm Whale — Moby Dick , have ye seen him ?
“ Never heard of such a whale .
<unk> <unk> !
White Whale — no . ” “ Very good , then ; good <unk> now , and I ’ ll call again in a minute . ” Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod , and seeing Ahab leaning over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report , he <unk> his two hands into a trumpet and shouted — “ No , Sir !
No ! ” Upon which Ahab retired , and Stubb returned to the Frenchman .
He now perceived that the Guernsey-man , who had just got into the chains , and was using a cutting-spade , had <unk> his nose in a sort of bag .
“ What ’ s the matter with your nose , there ? ” said Stubb .
“ <unk> it ? ” “ I wish it was broken , or that I didn ’ t have any nose at all ! ” answered the Guernsey-man , who did not seem to <unk> the job he was at very much .
“ But what are you holding _ yours _ for ? ” “ Oh , nothing !
It ’ s a <unk> nose ; I have to hold it on .
<unk> day , ain ’ t it ?
<unk> rather <unk> , I should say ; throw us a bunch of <unk> , will ye , <unk> ? ” “ What in the devil ’ s name do you want here ? ” roared the <unk> , flying into a sudden passion .
“ Oh !
keep cool — cool ?
yes , that ’ s the word !
why don ’ t you pack those whales in ice while you ’ re working at ’ em ?
But <unk> aside , though ; do you know , <unk> , that it ’ s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales ?
As for that dried up one , there , he hasn ’ t a <unk> in his whole carcase . ” “ I know that well enough ; but , d ’ ye see , the Captain here won ’ t believe it ; this is his first voyage ; he was a <unk> <unk> before .
But come aboard , and <unk> he ’ ll believe you , if he won ’ t me ; and so I ’ ll get out of this <unk> scrape . ” “ <unk> to <unk> ye , my sweet and pleasant fellow , ” <unk> Stubb , and with that he soon mounted to the deck .
There a queer scene presented itself .
The sailors , in <unk> <unk> of red <unk> , were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales .
But they worked rather slow and talked very fast , and seemed in anything but a good humor .
All their noses <unk> <unk> from their faces like so many <unk> .
Now and then <unk> of them would drop their work , and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air .
Some thinking they would catch the plague , <unk> oakum in <unk> , and at intervals held it to their nostrils .
<unk> having broken the <unk> of their pipes almost short off at the bowl , were vigorously puffing <unk> , so that it <unk> filled their <unk> .
Stubb was struck by a shower of <unk> and <unk> proceeding from the Captain ’ s <unk> <unk> ; and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door , which was held <unk> from within .
This was the tormented surgeon , who , after in vain <unk> against the proceedings of the day , had <unk> himself to the Captain ’ s <unk> ( _ <unk> _ he called it ) to avoid the <unk> ; but still , could not help <unk> out his <unk> and <unk> at times .
<unk> all this , Stubb argued well for his <unk> , and turning to the Guernsey-man had a little chat with him , during which the stranger mate expressed his <unk> of his Captain as a <unk> <unk> , who had brought them all into so <unk> and <unk> a pickle .
<unk> him carefully , Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris .
He therefore held his peace on that head , but otherwise was quite <unk> and confidential with him , so that the two quickly <unk> a little plan for both <unk> and <unk> the Captain , without his at all dreaming of <unk> their <unk> .
According to this little plan of theirs , the Guernsey-man , under cover of an <unk> ’ s office , was to tell the Captain what he pleased , but as coming from Stubb ; and as for Stubb , he was to utter any nonsense that should come <unk> in him during the <unk> .
By this time their destined <unk> appeared from his cabin .
He was a small and dark , but rather delicate looking man for a <unk> , with large whiskers and <unk> , however ; and wore a red <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> at his side .
To this gentleman , Stubb was now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man , who at once <unk> put on the aspect of <unk> between them .
“ What shall I say to him first ? ” said he .
“ Why , ” said Stubb , eyeing the <unk> <unk> and the watch and seals , “ you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of <unk> to me , though I don ’ t pretend to be a judge . ” “ He says , Monsieur , ” said the Guernsey-man , in French , turning to his captain , “ that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel , whose captain and chief-mate , with six sailors , had all died of a <unk> caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside . ” Upon this the captain started , and eagerly desired to know more .
“ What now ? ” said the Guernsey-man to Stubb .
“ Why , since he takes it so easy , tell him that now I have eyed him carefully , I ’ m quite certain that he ’ s no more fit to command a whale-ship than a St. <unk> monkey .
In fact , tell him from me he ’ s a <unk> . ” “ He <unk> and <unk> , Monsieur , that the other whale , the dried one , is far more deadly than the blasted one ; in fine , Monsieur , he <unk> us , as we value our lives , to cut loose from these fish . ” Instantly the captain ran forward , and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the <unk> , and at once cast loose the cables and chains <unk> the whales to the ship .
“ What now ? ” said the Guernsey-man , when the Captain had returned to them .
“ Why , let me see ; yes , you may as well tell him now that — that — in fact , tell him I ’ ve <unk> him , and ( aside to himself ) perhaps somebody else . ” “ He says , Monsieur , that he ’ s very happy to have been of any service to us . ” <unk> this , the captain <unk> that they were the <unk> parties ( meaning himself and mate ) and concluded by <unk> Stubb down into his cabin to drink a <unk> of <unk> .
“ He wants you to take a glass of wine with him , ” said the <unk> .
“ <unk> him <unk> ; but tell him it ’ s against my principles to drink with the man I ’ ve <unk> .
In fact , tell him I must go . ” “ He says , Monsieur , that his principles won ’ t admit of his drinking ; but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink , then Monsieur had best drop all four boats , and pull the ship away from these whales , for it ’ s so calm they won ’ t <unk> . ” By this time Stubb was over the side , and getting into his boat , hailed the Guernsey-man to this effect , — that having a long tow-line in his boat , he would do what he could to help them , by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship ’ s side .
While the Frenchman ’ s boats , then , were engaged in towing the ship one way , Stubb <unk> towed away at his whale the other way , <unk> <unk> out a most unusually long tow-line .
Presently a breeze sprang up ; Stubb <unk> to cast off from the whale ; hoisting his boats , the Frenchman soon increased his distance , while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb ’ s whale .
<unk> Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body , and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his <unk> , at once proceeded to <unk> the <unk> of his <unk> cunning .
<unk> his sharp <unk> , he commenced an <unk> in the body , a little behind the side fin .
You would almost have thought he was <unk> a <unk> there in the sea ; and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs , it was like turning up old Roman <unk> and <unk> buried in fat English <unk> .
His boat ’ s crew were all in high excitement , eagerly helping their chief , and looking as anxious as <unk> .
And all the time numberless fowls were diving , and <unk> , and screaming , and <unk> , and fighting around them .
Stubb was beginning to look <unk> , especially as the horrible <unk> increased , when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague , there stole a faint stream of <unk> , which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it , as one river will flow into and then along with another , without at all blending with it for a time .
“ I have it , I have it , ” cried Stubb , with delight , striking something in the subterranean <unk> , “ a purse !
a purse ! ” <unk> his spade , he thrust both hands in , and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe <unk> <unk> , or rich <unk> old cheese ; very unctuous and <unk> <unk> .
You might easily <unk> it with your <unk> ; it is of a hue between yellow and <unk> colour .
And this , good friends , is ambergris , worth a gold <unk> an ounce to any <unk> .
Some six handfuls were obtained ; but more was <unk> lost in the sea , and still more , perhaps , might have been secured were it not for impatient Ahab ’ s loud command to Stubb to desist , and come on board , else the ship would bid them good <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> .
Now this ambergris is a very curious substance , and so important as an article of commerce , that in <unk> a certain <unk> Captain Coffin was <unk> at the bar of the English <unk> of <unk> on that subject .
For at that time , and indeed until a comparatively late day , the precise <unk> of ambergris remained , like amber itself , a problem to the learned .
Though the word ambergris is but the French <unk> for grey amber , yet the two <unk> are quite distinct .
For amber , though at times found on the <unk> , is also <unk> up in some far inland <unk> , whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea .
Besides , amber is a hard , transparent , <unk> , <unk> substance , used for <unk> to pipes , for <unk> and <unk> ; but ambergris is soft , <unk> , and so highly fragrant and <unk> , that it is largely used in <unk> , in <unk> , precious candles , <unk> , and <unk> .
The <unk> use it in <unk> , and also carry it to <unk> , for the same purpose that <unk> is carried to St. Peter ’ s in Rome .
Some wine <unk> drop a few <unk> into <unk> , to flavor it .
Who would think , then , that such fine ladies and gentlemen should <unk> themselves with an <unk> found in the <unk> bowels of a sick whale !
Yet so it is .
By some , ambergris is supposed to be the cause , and by others the effect , of the dyspepsia in the whale .
How to <unk> such a dyspepsia it were hard to say , unless by <unk> three or four boat <unk> of <unk> ’ s <unk> , and then running out of harm ’ s way , as laborers do in <unk> rocks .
I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris , certain hard , round , bony plates , which at first Stubb thought might be sailors ’ trowsers <unk> ; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of small <unk> bones embalmed in that manner .
Now that the <unk> of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such <unk> ; is this nothing ?
<unk> thee of that saying of St. Paul in <unk> , about <unk> and <unk> ; how that we are <unk> in <unk> , but raised in glory .
And likewise call to mind that saying of <unk> about what it is that maketh the best musk .
<unk> forget not the strange fact that of all things of <unk> , <unk> , in its <unk> <unk> <unk> , is the <unk> .
I should like to conclude the chapter with the above <unk> , but cannot , owing to my <unk> to <unk> a charge often made against whalemen , and which , in the <unk> of some already <unk> minds , might be considered as indirectly <unk> by what has been said of the Frenchman ’ s two whales .
<unk> in this volume the <unk> <unk> has been <unk> , that the vocation of whaling is throughout a <unk> , <unk> business .
But there is another thing to <unk> .
They hint that all whales always smell bad .
Now how did this <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
I <unk> , that it is plainly <unk> to the first arrival of the Greenland whaling ships in London , more than two centuries ago .
Because those whalemen did not then , and do not now , try out their oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done ; but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits , thrust it through the <unk> <unk> of large casks , and carry it home in that manner ; the <unk> of the season in those <unk> Seas , and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed , <unk> any other course .
The consequence is , that upon breaking into the hold , and <unk> one of these whale <unk> , in the Greenland <unk> , a <unk> is given forth somewhat similar to that <unk> from <unk> an old city <unk> , for the foundations of a <unk> <unk> .
I partly <unk> also , that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise <unk> to the existence on the coast of Greenland , in former times , of a Dutch village called <unk> or <unk> , which latter name is the one used by the learned <unk> <unk> <unk> , in his great work on <unk> , a <unk> on that subject .
As its name <unk> ( <unk> , fat ; <unk> , to put up ) , this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out , without being taken home to Holland for that purpose .
It was a collection of <unk> , <unk> , and oil <unk> ; and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant <unk> .
But all this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm <unk> ; which in a voyage of four years perhaps , after completely filling her hold with oil , does not , perhaps , <unk> fifty days in the business of boiling out ; and in the state that it is <unk> , the oil is nearly <unk> .
The truth is , that living or dead , if but <unk> treated , whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor ; nor can whalemen be recognised , as the people of the middle ages affected to <unk> a <unk> in the company , by the nose .
Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant , when , as a general thing , he <unk> such high health ; taking abundance of <unk> ; always out of doors ; though , it is true , seldom in the open air .
I say , that the motion of a Sperm Whale ’ s flukes above water <unk> a <unk> , as when a <unk> lady <unk> her dress in a warm parlor .
What then shall I <unk> the Sperm Whale to for <unk> , considering his magnitude ?
<unk> it not be to that famous elephant , with <unk> tusks , and <unk> with <unk> , which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to <unk> the Great ?
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman , that a most significant event befell the most <unk> of the Pequod ’ s crew ; an event most <unk> ; and which ended in providing the sometimes <unk> merry and <unk> craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered <unk> might prove her own .
Now , in the whale ship , it is not every one that goes in the boats .
Some few hands are reserved called <unk> , whose <unk> it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale .
As a general thing , these <unk> are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats ’ crews .
But if there happen to be an <unk> slender , clumsy , or <unk> wight in the ship , that wight is certain to be made a <unk> .
It was so in the Pequod with the little negro <unk> by <unk> , Pip by <unk> .
Poor Pip !
ye have heard of him before ; ye must remember his tambourine on that <unk> midnight , so <unk> .
In outer aspect , Pip and Dough-Boy made a match , like a black <unk> and a white one , of equal <unk> , though of <unk> colour , driven in one <unk> <unk> .
But while <unk> Dough-Boy was by nature dull and <unk> in his <unk> , Pip , though over <unk> , was at bottom very bright , with that pleasant , genial , jolly <unk> peculiar to his tribe ; a tribe , which ever enjoy all <unk> and <unk> with <unk> , <unk> <unk> than any other race .
For <unk> , the year ’ s <unk> should show naught but three hundred and <unk> <unk> of <unk> and New <unk> ’ s <unk> .
Nor smile so , while I write that this little black was <unk> , for even blackness has its <unk> ; behold yon <unk> <unk> , <unk> in king ’ s <unk> .
But Pip <unk> life , and all life ’ s peaceable <unk> ; so that the <unk> business in which he had somehow <unk> become <unk> , had most sadly <unk> his <unk> ; though , as ere long will be seen , what was thus temporarily <unk> in him , in the end was destined to be <unk> <unk> by strange wild fires , that <unk> showed him off to ten times the natural <unk> with which in his native <unk> <unk> in <unk> , he had once <unk> many a <unk> ’ s <unk> on the green ; and at <unk> <unk> , with his gay <unk> !
had turned the round horizon into one <unk> tambourine .
So , though in the clear air of day , suspended against a <unk> neck , the <unk> <unk> drop will <unk> <unk> ; yet , when the cunning <unk> would show you the <unk> in its most <unk> <unk> , he lays it against a gloomy ground , and then lights it up , not by the sun , but by some unnatural <unk> .
Then come out those fiery <unk> , <unk> <unk> ; then the <unk> <unk> , once the <unk> symbol of the crystal skies , looks like some <unk> <unk> from the King of <unk> .
But let us to the story .
It came to pass , that in the ambergris affair Stubb ’ s <unk> chanced so to <unk> his hand , as for a time to become quite <unk> ; and , temporarily , Pip was put into his place .
The first time Stubb lowered with him , Pip evinced much <unk> ; but happily , for that time , escaped close contact with the whale ; and therefore came off not altogether <unk> ; though Stubb observing him , took care , afterwards , to <unk> him to cherish his <unk> to the utmost , for he might often find it <unk> .
Now upon the second lowering , the boat <unk> upon the whale ; and as the fish received the darted iron , it gave its customary <unk> , which happened , in this instance , to be right under poor Pip ’ s seat .
The <unk> consternation of the moment caused him to leap , <unk> in hand , out of the boat ; and in such a way , that part of the <unk> whale line coming against his chest , he <unk> it overboard with him , so as to become entangled in it , when at last <unk> into the water .
That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run , the line swiftly straightened ; and <unk> !
poor Pip came all <unk> up to the chocks of the boat , <unk> dragged there by the line , which had taken several turns around his chest and neck .
Tashtego stood in the bows .
He was full of the fire of the hunt .
He hated Pip for a <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from its <unk> , he suspended its sharp edge over the line , and turning towards Stubb , exclaimed <unk> , “ <unk> ? ” Meantime Pip ’ s blue , <unk> face plainly looked , Do , for God ’ s sake !
All passed in a flash .
In less than half a minute , this entire thing happened .
“ Damn him , cut ! ” roared Stubb ; and so the whale was lost and Pip was saved .
So soon as he recovered himself , the poor little negro was <unk> by <unk> and <unk> from the crew .
<unk> <unk> these irregular <unk> to <unk> , Stubb then in a plain , <unk> , but still half humorous manner , cursed Pip <unk> ; and that done , <unk> gave him much <unk> advice .
The substance was , Never jump from a boat , Pip , except — but all the rest was indefinite , as the <unk> advice ever is .
Now , in general , _ <unk> to the boat _ , is your true <unk> in whaling ; but cases will sometimes happen when _ <unk> from the boat _ , is still better .
Moreover , as if <unk> at last that if he should give <unk> conscientious advice to Pip , he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future ; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice , and concluded with a <unk> command , “ <unk> to the boat , Pip , or by the Lord , I won ’ t pick you up if you jump ; mind that .
We can ’ t afford to lose whales by the <unk> of you ; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would , Pip , in Alabama .
Bear that in mind , and don ’ t jump any more . ” <unk> perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted , that though man <unk> his fellow , yet man is a <unk> animal , which <unk> too often <unk> with his <unk> .
But we are all in the hands of the <unk> ; and Pip jumped again .
It was under very similar circumstances to the first <unk> ; but this time he did not breast out the line ; and hence , when the whale started to run , Pip was left behind on the sea , like a hurried traveller ’ s trunk .
<unk> !
Stubb was but too true to his word .
It was a beautiful , <unk> , blue day ; the <unk> sea calm and cool , and <unk> stretching away , all round , to the horizon , like <unk> ’ s skin hammered out to the <unk> .
<unk> up and down in that sea , Pip ’ s <unk> head showed like a head of <unk> .
No <unk> was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern .
Stubb ’ s <unk> back was turned upon him ; and the whale was <unk> .
In three minutes , a whole mile of <unk> ocean was between Pip and Stubb .
Out from the centre of the sea , poor Pip turned his <unk> , curling , black head to the sun , another lonely <unk> , though the <unk> and the <unk> .
Now , in calm weather , to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the <unk> <unk> as to <unk> in a <unk> ashore .
But the awful <unk> is intolerable .
The intense <unk> of self in the middle of such a <unk> <unk> , my God !
who can tell it ?
Mark , how when sailors in a dead calm <unk> in the open sea — mark how closely they <unk> their ship and only coast along her sides .
But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate ?
No ; he did not mean to , at least .
Because there were two boats in his wake , and he supposed , no doubt , that they would of course come up to Pip very quickly , and pick him up ; though , indeed , such considerations towards oarsmen <unk> through their own <unk> , is not always <unk> by the hunters in all similar instances ; and such instances not <unk> occur ; almost invariably in the fishery , a coward , so called , is marked with the same <unk> <unk> peculiar to military navies and <unk> .
But it so happened , that those boats , without seeing Pip , suddenly <unk> whales close to them on one side , turned , and gave chase ; and Stubb ’ s boat was now so far away , and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish , that Pip ’ s <unk> horizon began to expand around him <unk> .
By the <unk> chance the ship itself at last <unk> him ; but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an <unk> ; such , at least , they said he was .
The sea had <unk> kept his <unk> body up , but drowned the infinite of his soul .
Not drowned entirely , though .
Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths , where strange <unk> of the <unk> primal world glided to and fro before his <unk> eyes ; and the <unk> , <unk> , revealed his <unk> heaps ; and among the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Pip saw the <unk> , <unk> , coral <unk> , that out of the <unk> of waters heaved the colossal <unk> .
He saw God ’ s foot upon the <unk> of the loom , and spoke it ; and therefore his shipmates called him mad .
So man ’ s insanity is heaven ’ s sense ; and <unk> from all mortal reason , man comes at last to that celestial thought , which , to reason , is <unk> and frantic ; and <unk> or woe , feels then <unk> , indifferent as his God .
For the rest , <unk> not Stubb too hardly .
The thing is common in that fishery ; and in the <unk> of the narrative , it will then be seen what like <unk> befell myself .
CHAPTER <unk> .
A <unk> of the Hand .
That whale of Stubb ’ s , so <unk> <unk> , was duly brought to the Pequod ’ s side , where all those cutting and hoisting <unk> previously <unk> , were regularly gone through , even to the <unk> of the Heidelburgh Tun , or <unk> .
While some were occupied with this latter duty , others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs , so soon as filled with the sperm ; and when the proper time arrived , this same sperm was carefully <unk> ere going to the try-works , of which anon .
It had <unk> and <unk> to such a degree , that when , with several others , I sat down before a large <unk> ’ s <unk> of it , I found it strangely <unk> into <unk> , here and there rolling about in the <unk> part .
It was our business to squeeze these <unk> back into fluid .
A sweet and unctuous duty !
No wonder that in old times this sperm was such a favourite <unk> .
Such a <unk> !
such a <unk> !
such a <unk> !
such a <unk> <unk> !
After having my hands in it for only a few minutes , my fingers felt like <unk> , and began , as it were , to <unk> and <unk> .
As I sat there at my ease , <unk> on the deck ; after the bitter <unk> at the windlass ; under a blue <unk> sky ; the ship under indolent sail , and gliding so <unk> along ; as I <unk> my hands among those soft , gentle <unk> of <unk> <unk> , woven almost within the hour ; as they <unk> broke to my fingers , and <unk> all their <unk> , like fully ripe <unk> their wine ; as I snuffed up that <unk> <unk> , — literally and truly , like the smell of spring <unk> ; I declare to you , that for the time I lived as in a <unk> meadow ; I <unk> all about our horrible oath ; in that <unk> sperm , I washed my hands and my heart of it ; I almost began to credit the old <unk> superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in <unk> the heat of <unk> ; while <unk> in that <unk> , I felt <unk> free from all <unk> , or <unk> , or malice , of any sort whatsoever .
<unk> !
squeeze !
squeeze !
all the morning long ; I <unk> that sperm till I myself almost melted into it ; I <unk> that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me ; and I found myself <unk> <unk> my <unk> ’ hands in it , <unk> their hands for the gentle <unk> .
Such an abounding , affectionate , friendly , loving feeling did this <unk> beget ; that at last I was continually <unk> their hands , and looking up into their eyes <unk> ; as much as to say , — Oh !
my dear fellow beings , why should we longer cherish any social <unk> , or know the slightest <unk> or <unk> !
Come ; let us squeeze hands all round ; nay , let us all squeeze ourselves into each other ; let us squeeze ourselves <unk> into the very milk and sperm of <unk> .
Would that I could keep <unk> that sperm for ever !
For now , since by many prolonged , repeated experiences , I have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower , or at least <unk> , his conceit of <unk> <unk> ; not placing it anywhere in the <unk> or the fancy ; but in the wife , the heart , the bed , the table , the <unk> , the fireside , the country ; now that I have perceived all this , I am ready to squeeze case eternally .
In thoughts of the <unk> of the night , I saw long rows of angels in <unk> , each with his hands in a <unk> of spermaceti .
Now , while <unk> of sperm , it <unk> to speak of other things <unk> to it , in the business of <unk> the sperm whale for the try-works .
First comes <unk> , so called , which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish , and also from the <unk> <unk> of his flukes .
It is tough with <unk> tendons — a wad of <unk> — but still contains some oil .
After being <unk> from the whale , the <unk> is first cut into <unk> <unk> ere going to the mincer .
They look much like blocks of <unk> marble .
<unk> is the term bestowed upon certain <unk> parts of the whale ’ s flesh , here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber , and often <unk> to a considerable degree in its <unk> .
It is a most <unk> , convivial , beautiful object to behold .
As its name <unk> , it is of an exceedingly rich , <unk> <unk> , with a <unk> snowy and golden ground , dotted with <unk> of the deepest <unk> and purple .
It is <unk> of <unk> , in pictures of <unk> .
<unk> of reason , it is hard to keep yourself from eating it .
I confess , that once I stole behind the <unk> to try it .
It <unk> something as I should <unk> a royal <unk> from the thigh of Louis <unk> <unk> might have <unk> , <unk> him to have been killed the first day after the <unk> season , and that particular <unk> season <unk> with an unusually fine <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
There is another substance , and a very singular one , which turns up in the course of this business , but which I feel it to be very <unk> adequately to <unk> .
It is called <unk> ; an <unk> original with the whalemen , and even so is the nature of the substance .
It is an <unk> <unk> , <unk> affair , most frequently found in the tubs of sperm , after a prolonged <unk> , and subsequent <unk> .
I hold it to be the <unk> thin , <unk> <unk> of the case , <unk> .
<unk> , so called , is a term properly belonging to right whalemen , but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen .
It <unk> the dark , <unk> substance which is <unk> off the back of the Greenland or right whale , and much of which <unk> the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that <unk> Leviathan .
<unk> .
<unk> this word is not <unk> to the whale ’ s <unk> .
But as applied by whalemen , it becomes so .
A whaleman ’ s <unk> is a short firm strip of <unk> stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan ’ s tail : it <unk> an inch in thickness , and for the rest , is about the size of the iron part of a <unk> .
<unk> moved along the oily deck , it <unk> like a leathern <unk> ; and by nameless <unk> , as of magic , <unk> along with it all <unk> .
But to learn all about these <unk> matters , your best way is at once to descend into the <unk> , and have a long talk with its <unk> .
This place has previously been mentioned as the <unk> for the <unk> , when <unk> and hoisted from the whale .
When the proper time <unk> for cutting up its contents , this apartment is a scene of terror to all <unk> , especially by night .
On one side , <unk> by a dull lantern , a space has been left clear for the <unk> .
They generally go in <unk> , — a <unk> and a <unk> .
The <unk> is similar to a frigate ’ s <unk> of the same name .
The <unk> is something like a <unk> .
With his <unk> , the <unk> hooks on to a sheet of blubber , and <unk> to hold it from slipping , as the ship <unk> and <unk> about .
Meanwhile , the <unk> stands on the sheet itself , perpendicularly <unk> it into the <unk> <unk> .
This spade is sharp as <unk> can make it ; the <unk> ’ s feet are <unk> ; the thing he stands on will sometimes <unk> slide away from him , like a <unk> .
If he <unk> off one of his own toes , or one of his <unk> ’ , would you be very much astonished ?
<unk> are scarce among veteran <unk> men .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this <unk> of the whale ; and had you <unk> forward nigh the windlass , pretty sure am I that you would have <unk> with no small curiosity a very strange , <unk> object , which you would have seen there , lying along lengthwise in the lee <unk> .
Not the wondrous <unk> in the whale ’ s huge head ; not the <unk> of his <unk> lower jaw ; not the <unk> of his <unk> tail ; none of these would so surprise you , as half a glimpse of that unaccountable <unk> , — longer than a <unk> is tall , nigh a foot in <unk> at the base , and <unk> as Yojo , the <unk> idol of Queequeg .
And an idol , indeed , it is ; or , rather , in old times , its likeness was .
Such an idol as that found in the secret groves of Queen <unk> in <unk> ; and for worshipping which , King <unk> , her son , did <unk> her , and destroyed the idol , and burnt it for an <unk> at the <unk> <unk> , as <unk> set forth in the <unk> chapter of the First Book of Kings .
Look at the sailor , called the mincer , who now comes along , and <unk> by two <unk> , heavily backs the <unk> , as the mariners call it , and with bowed shoulders , <unk> off with it as if he were a <unk> carrying a dead comrade from the field .
<unk> it upon the forecastle deck , he now proceeds <unk> to remove its dark <unk> , as an <unk> hunter the <unk> of a <unk> .
This done he turns the <unk> inside out , like a <unk> leg ; gives it a good stretching , so as almost to double its <unk> ; and at last hangs it , well spread , in the rigging , to dry .
Ere long , it is taken down ; when removing some three feet of it , towards the pointed extremity , and then cutting two <unk> for <unk> at the other end , he lengthwise <unk> himself bodily into it .
The mincer now stands before you invested in the full <unk> of his calling .
<unk> to all his order , this <unk> alone will adequately <unk> him , while employed in the peculiar <unk> of his office .
That office consists in <unk> the <unk> of blubber for the pots ; an operation which is <unk> at a curious wooden horse , planted <unk> against the bulwarks , and with a <unk> tub beneath it , into which the <unk> pieces drop , fast as the sheets from a <unk> <unk> ’ s desk .
<unk> in decent black ; <unk> a conspicuous pulpit ; intent on <unk> leaves ; what a <unk> for an <unk> , what a lad for a <unk> were this mincer !
* * Bible leaves !
Bible leaves !
This is the <unk> cry from the mates to the mincer .
It <unk> him to be careful , and cut his work into as thin <unk> as possible , inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much <unk> , and its quantity considerably increased , besides perhaps <unk> it in quality .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
Besides her hoisted boats , an American whaler is <unk> distinguished by her try-works .
She presents the curious <unk> of the most solid masonry <unk> with oak and hemp in <unk> the completed ship .
It is as if from the open field a <unk> were <unk> to her planks .
The try-works are planted between the <unk> and mainmast , the most <unk> part of the deck .
The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength , fitted to <unk> the weight of an almost solid mass of <unk> and <unk> , some ten feet by eight square , and five in height .
The <unk> does not <unk> the deck , but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides , and <unk> it down to the timbers .
On the flanks it is <unk> with wood , and at top completely covered by a large , <unk> , <unk> hatchway .
<unk> this hatch we expose the great <unk> , two in number , and each of several barrels ’ <unk> .
When not in use , they are kept <unk> clean .
Sometimes they are polished with <unk> and sand , till they <unk> within like silver <unk> .
During the <unk> some <unk> old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap .
While employed in <unk> them — one man in each <unk> , side by side — many confidential <unk> are carried on , over the iron lips .
It is a place also for profound <unk> meditation .
It was in the left hand <unk> of the Pequod , with the <unk> diligently <unk> round me , that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact , that in <unk> all bodies gliding along the <unk> , my <unk> for example , will descend from any point in precisely the same time .
<unk> the <unk> from the front of the try-works , the bare masonry of that side is exposed , <unk> by the two iron mouths of the <unk> , directly <unk> the pots .
These mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron .
The intense heat of the fire is <unk> from <unk> itself to the deck , by means of a <unk> <unk> extending under the entire <unk> surface of the works .
By a <unk> inserted at the rear , this <unk> is kept replenished with water as fast as it <unk> .
There are no external <unk> ; they open direct from the rear wall .
And here let us go back for a moment .
It was about nine o ’ clock at night that the Pequod ’ s try-works were first started on this present voyage .
It belonged to Stubb to <unk> the business .
“ All ready there ?
<unk> hatch , then , and start her .
You cook , fire the works . ” This was an easy thing , for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the <unk> throughout the passage .
Here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be <unk> for a time with wood .
After that no wood is used , except as a means of quick <unk> to the <unk> fuel .
In a word , after being tried out , the <unk> , <unk> blubber , now called <unk> or <unk> , still contains considerable of its unctuous <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> the flames .
Like a <unk> burning <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> , once <unk> , the whale <unk> his own fuel and burns by his own body .
Would that he consumed his own smoke !
for his smoke is horrible to <unk> , and <unk> it you must , and not only that , but you must live in it for the time .
It has an unspeakable , wild , Hindoo odor about it , such as may lurk in the vicinity of <unk> <unk> .
It smells like the left wing of the day of judgment ; it is an argument for the pit .
By midnight the works were in full operation .
We were clear from the carcase ; sail had been made ; the wind was <unk> ; the wild ocean darkness was intense .
But that darkness was <unk> up by the fierce flames , which at intervals forked forth from the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> every lofty rope in the rigging , as with the <unk> Greek fire .
The burning ship <unk> on , as if <unk> <unk> to some vengeful deed .
So the pitch and <unk> <unk> of the bold <unk> , <unk> , <unk> from their midnight harbors , with broad sheets of flame for sails , bore down upon the Turkish <unk> , and folded them in <unk> .
The hatch , removed from the top of the works , now afforded a wide hearth in front of them .
Standing on this were the <unk> <unk> of the pagan harpooneers , always the whale-ship ’ s <unk> .
With huge <unk> poles they pitched <unk> masses of blubber into the scalding pots , or stirred up the fires beneath , till the <unk> flames darted , curling , out of the doors to catch them by the feet .
The smoke rolled away in sullen heaps .
To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil , which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces .
<unk> the mouth of the works , on the further side of the wide wooden hearth , was the windlass .
This served for a <unk> .
Here <unk> the watch , when not otherwise employed , looking into the red heat of the fire , till their eyes felt scorched in their heads .
Their tawny features , now all <unk> with smoke and <unk> , their <unk> <unk> , and the contrasting barbaric <unk> of their teeth , all these were strangely revealed in the <unk> <unk> of the works .
As they narrated to each other their <unk> adventures , their tales of terror told in words of <unk> ; as their <unk> <unk> forked upwards out of them , like the flames from the <unk> ; as to and fro , in their front , the harpooneers wildly <unk> with their huge <unk> <unk> and <unk> ; as the wind howled on , and the sea leaped , and the ship <unk> and dived , and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night , and <unk> <unk> the white bone in her mouth , and <unk> <unk> round her on all sides ; then the rushing Pequod , <unk> with savages , and laden with fire , and burning a corpse , and plunging into that blackness of darkness , seemed the material <unk> of her monomaniac commander ’ s soul .
So seemed it to me , as I stood at her helm , and for long hours silently <unk> the way of this <unk> on the sea .
<unk> , for that interval , in darkness myself , I but the better saw the <unk> , the madness , the <unk> of others .
The continual sight of the fiend <unk> before me , <unk> half in smoke and half in fire , these at last <unk> kindred <unk> in my soul , so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable <unk> which ever would come over me at a midnight helm .
But that night , in particular , a strange ( and ever since inexplicable ) thing occurred to me .
<unk> from a brief standing sleep , I was <unk> conscious of something <unk> wrong .
The <unk> tiller smote my side , which leaned against it ; in my ears was the low hum of sails , just beginning to shake in the wind ; I thought my eyes were open ; I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the <unk> and mechanically stretching them still further apart .
But , spite of all this , I could see no compass before me to steer by ; though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the <unk> , by the steady binnacle lamp <unk> it .
Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom , now and then made ghastly by flashes of <unk> .
<unk> was the impression , that whatever swift , rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all <unk> astern .
A stark , <unk> feeling , as of death , came over me .
<unk> my hands grasped the tiller , but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was , somehow , in some enchanted way , inverted .
My God !
what is the matter with me ?
thought I.
<unk> !
in my brief sleep I had turned myself about , and was <unk> the ship ’ s stern , with my back to her prow and the compass .
In an instant I <unk> back , just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind , and very probably <unk> her .
How glad and how <unk> the relief from this unnatural <unk> of the night , and the fatal <unk> of being brought by the lee !
Look not too long in the face of the fire , O man !
Never dream with thy hand on the helm !
Turn not thy back to the compass ; <unk> the first hint of the <unk> tiller ; believe not the artificial fire , when its <unk> makes all things look ghastly .
<unk> , in the natural sun , the skies will be bright ; those who <unk> like devils in the <unk> flames , the <unk> will show in far other , at least <unk> , relief ; the glorious , golden , glad sun , the only true lamp — all others but <unk> !
Nevertheless the sun <unk> not Virginia ’ s <unk> <unk> , nor Rome ’ s accursed <unk> , nor wide <unk> , nor all the millions of miles of <unk> and of <unk> beneath the moon .
The sun <unk> not the ocean , which is the dark side of this earth , and which is two thirds of this earth .
So , therefore , that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him , that mortal man cannot be true — not true , or <unk> .
With books the same .
The <unk> of all men was the Man of <unk> , and the <unk> of all books is Solomon ’ s , and <unk> is the fine hammered steel of woe .
“ All is <unk> . ” <unk> .
This wilful world hath not got hold of <unk> Solomon ’ s wisdom yet .
But he who <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> fast crossing <unk> , and would rather talk of <unk> than hell ; calls <unk> , Young , <unk> , <unk> , poor devils all of sick men ; and throughout a <unk> lifetime <unk> by <unk> as passing wise , and therefore jolly ; — not that man is fitted to sit down on <unk> , and break the green damp mould with <unk> wondrous Solomon .
But even Solomon , he says , “ the man that <unk> out of the way of understanding shall remain ” ( _ <unk> _ , even while living ) “ in the congregation of the dead . ” Give not thyself up , then , to fire , lest it <unk> thee , <unk> thee ; as for the time it did me .
There is a wisdom that is woe ; but there is a woe that is madness .
And there is a <unk> eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces .
And even if he for ever flies within the <unk> , that <unk> is in the mountains ; so that even in his <unk> <unk> the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain , even though they <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
Had you descended from the Pequod ’ s try-works to the Pequod ’ s forecastle , where the off duty watch were sleeping , for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some <unk> <unk> of <unk> kings and <unk> .
There they lay in their triangular oaken <unk> , each mariner a <unk> <unk> ; a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes .
In <unk> , oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens .
To dress in the dark , and eat in the dark , and <unk> in darkness to his <unk> , this is his usual lot .
But the whaleman , as he seeks the food of light , so he lives in light .
He makes his berth an <unk> ’ s lamp , and lays him down in it ; so that in the <unk> night the ship ’ s black hull still houses an <unk> .
See with what entire <unk> the whaleman takes his handful of lamps — often but old <unk> and <unk> , though — to the copper <unk> at the try-works , and <unk> them there , as <unk> of ale at a <unk> .
He burns , too , the <unk> of oil , in its <unk> , and , therefore , <unk> state ; a fluid unknown to <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> contrivances ashore .
It is sweet as early grass butter in <unk> .
He goes and <unk> for his oil , so as to be sure of its <unk> and <unk> , even as the traveller on the prairie <unk> up his own supper of game .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> Down and <unk> Up .
Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried from the mast-head ; how he is chased over the watery <unk> , and <unk> in the valleys of the deep ; how he is then towed alongside and beheaded ; and how ( on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to the <unk> in which the beheaded was killed ) his great <unk> <unk> becomes the property of his <unk> ; how , in due time , he is condemned to the pots , and , like <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , his spermaceti , oil , and bone pass <unk> through the fire ; — but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by <unk> — singing , if I may — the romantic proceeding of <unk> off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold , where once again leviathan <unk> to his native <unk> , sliding along beneath the surface as before ; but , alas !
never more to rise and blow .
While still warm , the oil , like hot punch , is received into the <unk> casks ; and while , perhaps , the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea , the enormous casks are <unk> round and headed over , end for end , and sometimes <unk> <unk> across the slippery deck , like so many land <unk> , till at last <unk> and stayed in their course ; and all round the hoops , <unk> , <unk> , go as many hammers as can play upon them , for now , _ <unk> <unk> _ , every sailor is a cooper .
At length , when the last <unk> is <unk> , and all is cool , then the great <unk> are <unk> , the bowels of the ship are thrown open , and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea .
This done , the hatches are <unk> , and <unk> closed , like a <unk> <unk> up .
In the sperm fishery , this is perhaps one of the most remarkable <unk> in all the business of whaling .
One day the planks stream with <unk> of blood and oil ; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of the whale ’ s head are <unk> piled ; great <unk> casks lie about , as in a <unk> yard ; the smoke from the try-works has <unk> all the bulwarks ; the mariners go about <unk> with <unk> ; the entire ship seems great leviathan himself ; while on all hands the din is <unk> .
But a day or two after , you look about you , and prick your ears in this <unk> ship ; and were it not for the <unk> boats and try-works , you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel , with a most <unk> <unk> commander .
The <unk> sperm oil <unk> a singularly <unk> virtue .
This is the reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil .
Besides , from the ashes of the burned <unk> of the whale , a potent <unk> is readily made ; and whenever any <unk> from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side , that <unk> quickly <unk> it .
Hands go diligently along the bulwarks , and with <unk> of water and <unk> <unk> them to their full <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> from the lower rigging .
All the numerous <unk> which have been in use are likewise <unk> <unk> and put away .
The great hatch is <unk> and placed upon the try-works , completely <unk> the pots ; every cask is out of sight ; all tackles are coiled in unseen <unk> ; and when by the combined and <unk> <unk> of almost the entire ship ’ s company , the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded , then the crew themselves proceed to their own <unk> ; <unk> themselves from top to <unk> ; and finally <unk> to the <unk> deck , fresh and all <unk> , as <unk> <unk> from out the <unk> Holland .
Now , with <unk> step , they pace the planks in <unk> and <unk> , and humorously <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and fine <unk> ; propose to mat the deck ; think of having hanging to the top ; object not to taking tea by moonlight on the <unk> of the forecastle .
To hint to such <unk> mariners of oil , and bone , and blubber , were little short of <unk> .
They know not the thing you <unk> <unk> to .
Away , and bring us <unk> !
But mark : aloft there , at the three mast heads , stand three men intent on <unk> out more whales , which , if caught , infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture , and drop at least one small <unk> somewhere .
Yes ; and many is the time , when , after the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which know no night ; <unk> straight through for <unk> hours ; when from the boat , where they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line , — they only step to the deck to carry vast chains , and heave the heavy windlass , and cut and <unk> , yea , and in their very <unk> to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works ; when , on the heel of all this , they have finally <unk> themselves to <unk> the ship , and make a <unk> <unk> room of it ; many is the time the poor fellows , just <unk> the <unk> of their clean <unk> , are startled by the cry of “ There she blows ! ” and away they fly to fight another whale , and go through the whole weary thing again .
Oh !
my friends , but this is <unk> !
Yet this is life .
For hardly have we mortals by long <unk> extracted from this world ’ s vast bulk its small but valuable sperm ; and then , with weary <unk> , <unk> ourselves from its <unk> , and learned to live here in clean <unk> of the soul ; hardly is this done , when — _ There she blows ! _ — the ghost is spouted up , and away we sail to fight some other world , and go through young life ’ s old <unk> again .
Oh !
the <unk> !
Oh !
<unk> , that in bright <unk> , two thousand years ago , did die , so good , so wise , so mild ; I sailed with thee along the <unk> coast last voyage — and , foolish as I am , <unk> thee , a green simple boy , how to splice a rope !
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Doubloon .
Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck , taking regular turns at either limit , the binnacle and mainmast ; but in the <unk> of other things <unk> <unk> it has not been added how that sometimes in these <unk> , when most plunged in his mood , he was wont to pause in turn at each spot , and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him .
When he <unk> before the binnacle , with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass , that glance shot like a <unk> with the pointed intensity of his purpose ; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast , then , as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there , he still wore the same aspect of nailed <unk> , only dashed with a certain wild <unk> , if not <unk> .
But one morning , turning to pass the doubloon , he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and <unk> <unk> on it , as though now for the first time beginning to <unk> for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them .
And some certain significance lurks in all things , else all things are little worth , and the round world itself but an empty <unk> , except to sell by the <unk> , as they do hills about <unk> , to fill up some <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Now this doubloon was of <unk> , virgin gold , <unk> somewhere out of the heart of <unk> hills , whence , east and west , over golden <unk> , the <unk> of many a <unk> <unk> .
And though now nailed <unk> all the <unk> of iron bolts and the <unk> of copper <unk> , yet , <unk> and <unk> to any <unk> , it still preserved its <unk> <unk> .
Nor , though placed <unk> a <unk> crew and every hour passed by <unk> hands , and through the <unk> nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any <unk> approach , nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last .
For it was set apart and <unk> to one <unk> end ; and however <unk> in their sailor ways , one and all , the mariners <unk> it as the white whale ’ s <unk> .
Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night , wondering whose it was to be at last , and whether he would ever live to spend it .
Now those noble golden coins of South America are as <unk> of the sun and tropic <unk> .
Here palms , <unk> , and <unk> ; sun ’ s <unk> and stars ; <unk> , <unk> , and rich <unk> waving , are in <unk> <unk> <unk> ; so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added <unk> and <unk> <unk> , by passing through those fancy <unk> , so <unk> <unk> .
It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most <unk> example of these things .
On its round <unk> it bore the letters , <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> .
So this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world , and beneath the great equator , and named after it ; and it had been cast midway up the Andes , in the <unk> <unk> that knows no <unk> .
<unk> by those letters you saw the likeness of three Andes ’ <unk> ; from one a flame ; a tower on another ; on the third a <unk> cock ; while <unk> over all was a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the signs all marked with their usual <unk> , and the <unk> sun entering the <unk> point at <unk> .
<unk> this equatorial coin , Ahab , not <unk> by others , was now pausing .
“ There ’ s something ever <unk> in <unk> and <unk> , and all other grand and lofty things ; look here , — three <unk> as proud as <unk> .
The firm tower , that is Ahab ; the <unk> , that is Ahab ; the <unk> , the <unk> , and <unk> fowl , that , too , is Ahab ; all are Ahab ; and this round gold is but the image of the <unk> globe , which , like a <unk> ’ s glass , to each and every man in turn but <unk> back his own mysterious self .
Great pains , small <unk> for those who ask the world to <unk> them ; it cannot <unk> itself .
Methinks now this <unk> sun wears a <unk> face ; but see !
aye , he enters the sign of storms , the <unk> !
and but six months before he <unk> out of a former <unk> at <unk> !
From storm to storm !
So be it , then .
<unk> in <unk> , ’ tis fit that man should live in pains and die in <unk> !
So be it , then !
Here ’ s stout stuff for woe to work on .
So be it , then . ” “ No <unk> fingers can have pressed the gold , but devil ’ s <unk> must have left their <unk> there since yesterday , ” murmured Starbuck to himself , leaning against the bulwarks .
“ The old man seems to read Belshazzar ’ s awful writing .
I have never marked the coin <unk> .
He goes below ; let me read .
A dark valley between three mighty , <unk> <unk> , that almost seem the <unk> , in some faint earthly symbol .
So in this <unk> of Death , God <unk> us round ; and over all our gloom , the sun of <unk> still <unk> a <unk> and a hope .
If we bend down our eyes , the dark <unk> shows her mouldy soil ; but if we lift them , the bright sun <unk> our glance half way , to cheer .
Yet , oh , the great sun is no <unk> ; and if , at midnight , we would fain <unk> some sweet <unk> from him , we gaze for him in vain !
This coin <unk> <unk> , mildly , truly , but still sadly to me .
I will quit it , lest Truth shake me <unk> . ” “ There now ’ s the old Mogul , ” soliloquized Stubb by the try-works , “ he ’ s been <unk> it ; and there goes Starbuck from the same , and both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long .
And all from looking at a piece of gold , which did I have it now on <unk> <unk> or in <unk> ’ s <unk> , I ’ d not look at it very long ere spending it .
<unk> !
in my poor , <unk> opinion , I regard this as queer .
I have seen doubloons before now in my <unk> ; your doubloons of old Spain , your doubloons of Peru , your doubloons of <unk> , your doubloons of <unk> , your doubloons of <unk> ; with plenty of gold <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and half <unk> , and quarter <unk> .
What then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so <unk> wonderful ?
By <unk> !
let me read it once .
Halloa !
here ’ s signs and wonders truly !
That , now , is what old <unk> in his <unk> calls the <unk> , and what my <unk> below calls <unk> .
I ’ ll get the <unk> and as I have heard devils can be raised with <unk> ’ s <unk> , I ’ ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer <unk> here with the <unk> <unk> .
Here ’ s the book .
Let ’ s see now .
<unk> and wonders ; and the sun , he ’ s always among ’ em .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ; here they are — here they go — all alive : — <unk> , or the <unk> ; <unk> , or the <unk> and <unk> !
here ’ s <unk> himself , or the <unk> .
Well ; the sun he <unk> among ’ em .
Aye , here on the coin he ’ s just crossing the threshold between two of twelve <unk> all in a ring .
Book !
you lie there ; the fact is , you books must know your places .
You ’ ll do to give us the bare words and facts , but we come in to supply the thoughts .
That ’ s my small experience , so far as the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> ’ s <unk> , and <unk> ’ s <unk> go .
<unk> and wonders , eh ?
<unk> if there is nothing wonderful in signs , and significant in wonders !
There ’ s a <unk> somewhere ; wait a bit ; <unk> — <unk> !
By Jove , I have it !
Look you , Doubloon , your <unk> here is the life of man in one round chapter ; and now I ’ ll read it off , straight out of the book .
Come , <unk> !
To begin : there ’ s <unk> , or the <unk> — <unk> dog , he <unk> us ; then , <unk> , or the <unk> — he <unk> us the first thing ; then <unk> , or the <unk> — that is , Virtue and <unk> ; we try to reach Virtue , when lo !
comes <unk> the <unk> , and drags us back ; and here , going from Virtue , <unk> , a roaring <unk> , lies in the path — he gives a few fierce <unk> and <unk> <unk> with his <unk> ; we escape , and hail <unk> , the Virgin !
that ’ s our first love ; we <unk> and think to be happy for aye , when <unk> comes <unk> , or the <unk> — <unk> <unk> and found wanting ; and while we are very sad about that , Lord !
how we suddenly jump , as <unk> , or the <unk> , <unk> us in the rear ; we are <unk> the wound , when <unk> come the <unk> all round ; <unk> , or the <unk> , is <unk> himself .
As we <unk> out the <unk> , stand aside !
here ’ s the <unk> , <unk> , or the <unk> ; full <unk> , he comes rushing , and headlong we are tossed ; when <unk> , or the <unk> , <unk> out his whole <unk> and <unk> us ; and to wind up with <unk> , or the <unk> , we sleep .
There ’ s a <unk> now , <unk> in high heaven , and the sun goes through it every year , and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty .
<unk> he , aloft there , <unk> through toil and trouble ; and so , <unk> here , does jolly Stubb .
Oh , jolly ’ s the word for aye !
<unk> , Doubloon !
But stop ; here comes little King-Post ; <unk> round the try-works , now , and let ’ s hear what he ’ ll have to say .
There ; he ’ s before it ; he ’ ll out with something presently .
So , so ; he ’ s beginning . ” “ I see nothing here , but a round thing made of gold , and whoever raises a certain whale , this round thing belongs to him .
So , what ’ s all this staring been about ?
It is worth sixteen dollars , that ’ s true ; and at two <unk> the <unk> , that ’ s nine hundred and sixty <unk> .
I won ’ t smoke <unk> pipes like Stubb , but I like <unk> , and here ’ s nine hundred and sixty of them ; so here goes Flask aloft to <unk> ’ em out . ” “ Shall I call that wise or foolish , now ; if it be really wise it has a foolish look to it ; yet , if it be really foolish , then has it a sort of <unk> look to it .
But , avast ; here comes our old Manxman — the old <unk> , he must have been , that is , before he took to the sea .
He <unk> up before the doubloon ; <unk> , and goes round on the other side of the mast ; why , there ’ s a <unk> nailed on that side ; and now he ’ s back again ; what does that mean ?
Hark !
he ’ s muttering — voice like an old <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ears , and listen ! ” “ If the White Whale be raised , it must be in a month and a day , when the sun stands in some one of these signs .
I ’ ve <unk> signs , and know their marks ; they were <unk> me two score years ago , by the old <unk> in <unk> .
Now , in what sign will the sun then be ?
The <unk> sign ; for there it is , right opposite the gold .
And what ’ s the <unk> sign ?
The <unk> is the <unk> sign — the roaring and <unk> <unk> .
Ship , old ship !
my old head shakes to think of thee . ” “ There ’ s another <unk> now ; but still one text .
All sorts of men in one kind of world , you see .
<unk> again !
here comes Queequeg — all tattooing — looks like the signs of the <unk> himself .
What says the <unk> ?
As I live he ’ s <unk> <unk> ; looking at his thigh bone ; thinks the sun is in the thigh , or in the <unk> , or in the bowels , I suppose , as the old women talk <unk> ’ s <unk> in the back country .
And by Jove , he ’ s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh — I guess it ’ s <unk> , or the <unk> .
No : he don ’ t know what to make of the doubloon ; he takes it for an old <unk> off some king ’ s trowsers .
But , aside again !
here comes that <unk> , Fedallah ; tail coiled out of sight as usual , oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual .
What does he say , with that look of his ?
Ah , only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself ; there is a sun on the coin — fire <unk> , depend upon it .
Ho !
more and more .
This way comes Pip — poor boy !
would he had died , or I ; he ’ s half horrible to me .
He too has been watching all of these <unk> — myself included — and look now , he comes to read , with that unearthly <unk> face .
Stand away again and hear him .
Hark ! ” “ I look , you look , he looks ; we look , ye look , they look . ” “ Upon my soul , he ’ s been studying <unk> ’ s <unk> !
<unk> his mind , poor fellow !
But what ’ s that he says now — <unk> ! ” “ I look , you look , he looks ; we look , ye look , they look . ” “ Why , he ’ s getting it by heart — <unk> !
again . ” “ I look , you look , he looks ; we look , ye look , they look . ” “ Well , that ’ s funny . ” “ And I , you , and he ; and we , ye , and they , are all <unk> ; and I ’ m a crow , especially when I stand a ’ top of this pine tree here .
<unk> !
caw !
caw !
caw !

caw !
<unk> ’ t I a crow ?
And where ’ s the <unk> ?
There he stands ; two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers , and two more <unk> into the sleeves of an old jacket . ” “ <unk> if he means me ? — <unk> ! — poor lad ! — I could go hang myself .
Any way , for the present , I ’ ll quit Pip ’ s vicinity .
I can stand the rest , for they have plain <unk> ; but he ’ s too <unk> for my <unk> .
So , so , I leave him muttering . ” “ Here ’ s the ship ’ s <unk> , this doubloon here , and they are all on fire to <unk> it .
But , <unk> your <unk> , and what ’ s the consequence ?
Then again , if it <unk> here , that is <unk> , too , for when aught ’ s nailed to the mast it ’ s a sign that things grow desperate .
Ha , ha !
old Ahab !
the White Whale ; he ’ ll nail ye !
This is a pine tree .
My father , in old <unk> <unk> , cut down a pine tree once , and found a silver ring grown over in it ; some old <unk> ’ s wedding ring .
How did it get there ?
And so they ’ ll say in the resurrection , when they come to fish up this old mast , and find a doubloon lodged in it , with <unk> <unk> for the shaggy <unk> .
Oh , the gold !

the green <unk> ’ ll <unk> ye soon !

Cook !
ho , cook !

hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , <unk> , <unk> !

Leg and <unk> .
The Pequod , of Nantucket , Meets the Samuel Enderby , of London .
“ Ship , ahoy !
Hast seen the White Whale ? ” So cried Ahab , once more hailing a ship showing English colours , bearing down under the stern .
<unk> to mouth , the old man was standing in his hoisted <unk> , his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain , who was <unk> <unk> in his own boat ’ s bow .
He was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> man , of sixty or <unk> , dressed in a <unk> <unk> , that hung round him in <unk> of blue <unk> ; and one empty arm of this jacket <unk> behind him like the <unk> arm of a <unk> ’ s <unk> .
“ Hast seen the White Whale ? ” “ See you this ? ” and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it , he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone , <unk> in a wooden head like a <unk> .
“ Man my boat ! ” cried Ahab , <unk> , and tossing about the oars near him — “ Stand by to lower ! ” In less than a minute , without <unk> his little craft , he and his crew were dropped to the water , and were soon alongside of the stranger .
But here a curious difficulty presented itself .
In the excitement of the moment , Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own , and then it was always by an <unk> and very <unk> mechanical <unk> peculiar to the Pequod , and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment ’ s warning .
Now , it is no very easy matter for anybody — except those who are almost <unk> used to it , like whalemen — to <unk> up a ship ’ s side from a boat on the open sea ; for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks , and then <unk> drop it half way down to the <unk> .
So , <unk> of one leg , and the strange ship of course being altogether <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , Ahab now found himself <unk> <unk> to a clumsy landsman again ; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain <unk> height he could hardly hope to <unk> .
It has before been hinted , perhaps , that every little <unk> circumstance that befell him , and which indirectly sprang from his <unk> <unk> , almost invariably <unk> or exasperated Ahab .
And in the present instance , all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship , leaning over the side , by the perpendicular ladder of nailed <unk> there , and swinging towards him a pair of <unk> <unk> ; for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a <unk> man must be too much of a <unk> to use their sea <unk> .
But this <unk> only <unk> a minute , because the strange captain , observing at a glance how affairs stood , cried out , “ I see , I see ! — avast heaving there !
<unk> , boys , and swing over the <unk> . ” As good luck would have it , they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous , and the great tackles were still aloft , and the massive curved <unk> , now clean and dry , was still attached to the end .
This was quickly lowered to Ahab , who at once <unk> it all , slid his solitary thigh into the <unk> of the hook ( it was like sitting in the <unk> of an anchor , or the crotch of an <unk> tree ) , and then giving the word , held himself fast , and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight , by pulling <unk> upon one of the running parts of the tackle .
Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks , and gently landed upon the capstan head .
With his ivory arm <unk> thrust forth in welcome , the other captain advanced , and Ahab , putting out his ivory leg , and crossing the ivory arm ( like two sword-fish blades ) cried out in his walrus way , “ Aye , aye , hearty !
let us shake bones together ! — an arm and a leg ! — an arm that never can <unk> , d ’ ye see ; and a leg that never can run .
Where did ’ st thou see the White Whale ? — how long ago ? ” “ The White Whale , ” said the Englishman , pointing his ivory arm towards the East , and taking a <unk> sight along it , as if it had been a <unk> ; “ there I saw him , on the Line , last season . ” “ And he took that arm off , did he ? ” asked Ahab , now sliding down from the capstan , and resting on the Englishman ’ s shoulder , as he did so .
“ Aye , he was the cause of it , at least ; and that leg , too ? ” “ <unk> me the yarn , ” said Ahab ; “ how was it ? ” “ It was the first time in my life that I ever <unk> on the Line , ” began the Englishman .
“ I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time .
Well , one day we lowered for a <unk> of four or five whales , and my boat fastened to one of them ; a regular <unk> horse he was , too , that went <unk> and <unk> round so , that my boat ’ s crew could only <unk> dish , by sitting all their <unk> on the outer gunwale .
Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a <unk> great whale , with a <unk> head and hump , all <unk> ’ feet and wrinkles . ” “ It was he , it was he ! ” cried Ahab , suddenly <unk> out his suspended breath .
“ And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin . ” “ Aye , aye — they were mine — _ my _ irons , ” cried Ahab , <unk> — “ but on ! ” “ Give me a chance , then , ” said the Englishman , <unk> .
“ Well , this old <unk> , with the white head and hump , runs all <unk> into the <unk> , and goes to <unk> furiously at my <unk> !
“ Aye , I see ! — wanted to part it ; free the <unk> — an old trick — I know him . ” “ How it was exactly , ” continued the <unk> commander , “ I do not know ; but in biting the line , it got foul of his teeth , caught there somehow ; but we didn ’ t know it then ; so that when we afterwards pulled on the line , <unk> we came <unk> on to his hump !
instead of the other whale ’ s ; that went off to windward , all <unk> .
Seeing how matters stood , and what a noble great whale it was — the <unk> and <unk> I ever saw , sir , in my life — I resolved to capture him , spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in .
And thinking the <unk> line would get loose , or the tooth it was <unk> to might draw ( for I have a devil of a boat ’ s crew for a pull on a whale-line ) ; seeing all this , I say , I jumped into my first mate ’ s boat — Mr.
<unk> ’ s here ( by the way , Captain — <unk> ; <unk> — the captain ) ; — as I was saying , I jumped into <unk> ’ s boat , which , d ’ ye see , was gunwale and gunwale with mine , then ; and snatching the first harpoon , let this old <unk> have it .
But , Lord , look you , sir — hearts and souls alive , man — the next instant , in a <unk> , I was blind as a <unk> — both eyes out — all <unk> and <unk> with black foam — the whale ’ s tail <unk> straight up out of it , perpendicular in the air , like a marble <unk> .
No use <unk> all , then ; but as I was groping at <unk> , with a blinding sun , all <unk> ; as I was groping , I say , after the second iron , to toss it overboard — down comes the tail like a Lima tower , cutting my boat in two , leaving each half in splinters ; and , flukes first , the white hump backed through the wreck , as though it was all chips .
We all struck out .
To escape his terrible <unk> , I seized hold of my <unk> sticking in him , and for a moment <unk> to that like a sucking fish .
But a <unk> sea dashed me off , and at the same instant , the fish , taking one good dart forwards , went down like a flash ; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here ” ( clapping his hand just below his shoulder ) ; “ yes , caught me just here , I say , and bore me down to <unk> ’ s flames , I was thinking ; when , when , all of a sudden , thank the good God , the barb <unk> its way along the flesh — clear along the whole length of my arm — came out nigh my wrist , and up I floated ; — and that gentleman there will tell you the rest ( by the way , captain — Dr.
Bunger , ship ’ s surgeon : Bunger , my lad , — the captain ) .
Now , Bunger boy , <unk> your part of the yarn . ” The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out , had been all the time standing near them , with nothing specific visible , to <unk> his <unk> <unk> on board .
His face was an exceedingly round but sober one ; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen <unk> or shirt , and patched trowsers ; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a <unk> he held in one hand , and a <unk> held in the other , occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two <unk> captains .
But , at his superior ’ s <unk> of him to Ahab , he politely bowed , and straightway went on to do his captain ’ s bidding .
“ It was a <unk> bad wound , ” began the <unk> ; “ and , taking my advice , Captain <unk> here , stood our old <unk> — ” “ Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship , ” interrupted the <unk> captain , <unk> Ahab ; “ go on , boy . ” “ <unk> our old <unk> off to the northward , to get out of the blazing hot weather there on the Line .
But it was no use — I did all I could ; sat up with him nights ; was very severe with him in the matter of <unk> — ” “ Oh , very severe ! ” <unk> in the patient himself ; then suddenly <unk> his voice , “ <unk> hot <unk> <unk> with me every night , till he couldn ’ t see to put on the <unk> ; and sending me to bed , half seas over , about three o ’ clock in the morning .
Oh , ye stars !
he sat up with me indeed , and was very severe in my <unk> .
Oh !
a great <unk> , and very <unk> severe , is Dr. Bunger .
( Bunger , you dog , laugh out !
why don ’ t ye ?
You know you ’ re a precious jolly rascal . )
But , heave ahead , boy , I ’ d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man . ” “ My captain , you must have ere this perceived , <unk> sir ” — said the <unk> <unk> Bunger , slightly bowing to Ahab — “ is apt to be <unk> at times ; he <unk> us many <unk> things of that sort .
But I may as well say — <unk> <unk> , as the French <unk> — that I myself — that is to say , <unk> Bunger , late of the reverend <unk> — am a <unk> <unk> <unk> man ; I never drink — ” “ Water ! ” cried the captain ; “ he never <unk> it ; it ’ s a sort of fits to him ; fresh water <unk> him into the <unk> ; but go on — go on with the arm story . ” “ Yes , I may as well , ” said the surgeon , coolly .
“ I was about observing , sir , before Captain <unk> ’ s <unk> <unk> , that spite of my best and <unk> endeavors , the wound kept getting worse and worse ; the truth was , sir , it was as <unk> <unk> wound as surgeon ever saw ; more than two feet and several inches long .
I measured it with the lead line .
In short , it grew black ; I knew what was threatened , and off it came .
But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there ; that thing is against all rule ” — pointing at it with the <unk> — “ that is the captain ’ s work , not mine ; he ordered the carpenter to make it ; he had that <unk> there put to the end , to <unk> some one ’ s brains out with , I suppose , as he tried mine once .
He flies into <unk> <unk> sometimes .
Do ye see this <unk> , sir ” — removing his hat , and <unk> aside his hair , and <unk> a <unk> cavity in his skull , but which bore not the slightest <unk> trace , or any token of ever having been a wound — “ Well , the captain there will tell you how that came here ; he knows . ” “ No , I don ’ t , ” said the captain , “ but his mother did ; he was born with it .
Oh , you solemn <unk> , you — you Bunger !
was there ever such another Bunger in the watery world ?
Bunger , when you die , you ought to die in pickle , you dog ; you should be preserved to future ages , you rascal . ” “ What became of the White Whale ? ” now cried Ahab , who thus far had been <unk> listening to this <unk> between the two <unk> .
“ Oh ! ” cried the <unk> captain , “ oh , yes !
Well ; after he sounded , we didn ’ t see him again for some time ; in fact , as I before hinted , I didn ’ t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick , till some time afterwards , when coming back to the Line , we heard about Moby Dick — as some call him — and then I knew it was he . ” “ Did ’ st thou cross his wake again ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ But could not fasten ? ” “ Didn ’ t want to try to : ain ’ t one limb enough ?
What should I do without this other arm ?
And I ’ m thinking Moby Dick <unk> ’ t <unk> so much as he <unk> . ” “ Well , then , ” interrupted Bunger , “ give him your left arm for <unk> to get the right .
Do you know , gentlemen ” — very <unk> and <unk> bowing to each Captain in succession — “ Do you know , gentlemen , that the <unk> <unk> of the whale are so <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> , that it is quite impossible for him to completely <unk> even a man ’ s arm ?
And he knows it too .
So that what you take for the White Whale ’ s malice is only his <unk> .
For he never means to swallow a single limb ; he only thinks to <unk> by <unk> .
But sometimes he is like the old <unk> fellow , <unk> a patient of mine in <unk> , that making believe swallow <unk> , once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest , and there it stayed for a <unk> or more ; when I gave him an <unk> , and he heaved it up in small <unk> , d ’ ye see .
No possible way for him to <unk> that jack-knife , and fully <unk> it into his general bodily system .
Yes , Captain <unk> , if you are quick enough about it , and have a mind to <unk> one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent <unk> to the other , why in that case the arm is yours ; only let the whale have another chance at you shortly , that ’ s all . ” “ No , thank ye , Bunger , ” said the English Captain , “ he ’ s welcome to the arm he has , since I can ’ t help it , and didn ’ t know him then ; but not to another one .
No more White Whales for me ; I ’ ve lowered for him once , and that has satisfied me .
There would be great glory in <unk> him , I know that ; and there is a <unk> of precious sperm in him , but , <unk> ye , he ’ s best let alone ; don ’ t you think so , Captain ? ” — glancing at the ivory leg .
“ He is .
But he will still be hunted , for all that .
What is best let alone , that accursed thing is not always what least <unk> .
He ’ s all a <unk> !
How long since thou saw ’ st him last ?
Which way heading ? ” “ <unk> my soul , and <unk> the foul fiend ’ s , ” cried Bunger , <unk> walking round Ahab , and like a dog , strangely <unk> ; “ this man ’ s blood — bring the <unk> ! — it ’ s at the boiling point ! — his <unk> makes these planks beat ! — sir ! ” — taking a <unk> from his pocket , and drawing near to Ahab ’ s arm .
“ Avast ! ” roared Ahab , dashing him against the bulwarks — “ Man the boat !
Which way heading ? ” “ Good God ! ” cried the English Captain , to whom the question was put .
“ What ’ s the matter ?
He was heading east , I think . — Is your Captain crazy ? ” <unk> Fedallah .
But Fedallah , putting a finger on his lip , slid over the bulwarks to take the boat ’ s steering oar , and Ahab , swinging the <unk> towards him , commanded the ship ’ s sailors to stand by to lower .
In a moment he was standing in the boat ’ s stern , and the Manilla men were springing to their oars .
In vain the English Captain hailed him .
With back to the stranger ship , and face set like a <unk> to his own , Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
Ere the English ship <unk> from sight , be it set down here , that she hailed from London , and was named after the late Samuel Enderby , merchant of that city , the original of the famous whaling house of Enderby <unk> <unk> ; a house which in my poor whaleman ’ s opinion , comes not far behind the united royal houses of the <unk> and <unk> , in point of real historical interest .
How long , prior to the year of our Lord <unk> , this great whaling house was in existence , my numerous <unk> do not make plain ; but in that year ( <unk> ) it fitted out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale ; though for some score of years previous ( ever since <unk> ) our valiant <unk> and <unk> of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large <unk> pursued that Leviathan , but only in the North and South Atlantic : not elsewhere .
Be it distinctly recorded here , that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale ; and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him .
In <unk> , a fine ship , the <unk> , fitted out for the express purpose , and at the sole charge of the vigorous <unk> , boldly rounded Cape Horn , and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the great South Sea .
The voyage was a <unk> and lucky one ; and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm , the <unk> ’ s example was soon followed by other ships , English and American , and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open .
But not content with this good deed , the <unk> house again <unk> itself : Samuel and all his <unk> — how many , their mother only knows — and under their immediate <unk> , and partly , I think , at their expense , the <unk> <unk> was induced to send the <unk> <unk> on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea .
<unk> by a <unk> <unk> , the <unk> made a rattling voyage of it , and did some service ; how much does not appear .
But this is not all .
In <unk> , the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own , to go on a <unk> cruise to the remote waters of Japan .
That ship — well called the “ <unk> ” — made a noble <unk> cruise ; and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known .
The <unk> in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin , a Nantucketer .
All honor to the <unk> , therefore , whose house , I think , exists to the present day ; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world .
The ship named after him was worthy of the honor , being a very fast <unk> and a noble craft every way .
I boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the Patagonian coast , and <unk> good flip down in the forecastle .
It was a fine <unk> we had , and they were all <unk> — every soul on board .
A short life to them , and a jolly death .
And that fine <unk> I had — long , very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel — it minds me of the noble , solid , <unk> <unk> of that ship ; and may my <unk> forget me , and the devil remember me , if I ever lose sight of it .
<unk> ?
Did I say we had flip ?
Yes , and we <unk> it at the rate of ten gallons the hour ; and when the squall came ( for it ’ s <unk> off there by <unk> ) , and all hands — <unk> and all — were called to <unk> <unk> , we were so <unk> that we had to swing each other aloft in <unk> ; and we ignorantly <unk> the <unk> of our jackets into the sails , so that we hung there , <unk> fast in the howling gale , a warning example to all <unk> <unk> .
However , the masts did not go overboard ; and by and by we <unk> down , so sober , that we had to pass the flip again , though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle , rather too much <unk> and <unk> it to my taste .
The beef was fine — tough , but with body in it .
They said it was <unk> ; others , that it was <unk> beef ; but I do not know , for certain , how that was .
They had dumplings too ; small , but <unk> , <unk> globular , and <unk> dumplings .
I fancied that you could feel them , and roll them about in you after they were swallowed .
If you stooped over too far forward , you <unk> their pitching out of you like <unk> .
The bread — but that couldn ’ t be helped ; besides , it was an <unk> ; in short , the bread contained the only fresh fare they had .
But the forecastle was not very light , and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you <unk> it .
But all in all , taking her from <unk> to helm , considering the <unk> of the cook ’ s <unk> , including his own live <unk> <unk> ; fore and aft , I say , the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship ; of good fare and plenty ; fine flip and strong ; crack fellows all , and <unk> from <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
But why was it , think ye , that the Samuel Enderby , and some other English whalers I know of — not all though — were such famous , hospitable ships ; that passed round the beef , and the bread , and the can , and the joke ; and were not soon weary of eating , and drinking , and <unk> ?
I will tell you .
The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter for historical research .
Nor have I been at all <unk> of historical whale research , when it has seemed needed .
The English were <unk> in the whale fishery by the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ; from whom they derived many terms still <unk> in the fishery ; and what is yet more , their fat old <unk> , touching plenty to eat and drink .
For , as a general thing , the English <unk> <unk> her crew ; but not so the English whaler .
Hence , in the English , this thing of whaling good cheer is not <unk> and natural , but <unk> and particular ; and , therefore , must have some special <unk> , which is here pointed out , and will be still further <unk> .
During my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , I <unk> upon an ancient Dutch volume , which , by the <unk> whaling smell of it , I knew must be about whalers .
The title was , “ Dan <unk> , ” wherefore I concluded that this must be the <unk> <unk> of some <unk> cooper in the fishery , as every whale ship must carry its cooper .
I was <unk> in this opinion by seeing that it was the <unk> of one “ <unk> <unk> . ” But my friend Dr. <unk> , a very learned man , professor of <unk> Dutch and High German in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and St. <unk> ’ s , to whom I <unk> the work for <unk> , giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble — this same Dr. <unk> , so soon as he <unk> the book , assured me that “ Dan <unk> ” did not mean “ The <unk> , ” but “ The <unk> . ” In short , this ancient and learned <unk> Dutch book treated of the commerce of Holland ; and , among other subjects , contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery .
And in this chapter it was , headed , “ <unk> , ” or “ <unk> , ” that I found a long <unk> list of the <unk> for the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> sail of Dutch whalemen ; from which list , as <unk> by Dr. <unk> , I <unk> the following : <unk> lbs .
of beef .
<unk> lbs .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> lbs .
of stock fish .
<unk> lbs .
of biscuit .
<unk> lbs .
of soft bread .
<unk> <unk> of butter .
<unk> lbs .
<unk> <unk> <unk> cheese .
<unk> lbs .
cheese ( probably an inferior article ) .
<unk> <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> barrels of beer .
Most <unk> <unk> are <unk> dry in the reading ; not so in the present case , however , where the reader is <unk> with whole pipes , barrels , <unk> , and gills of good gin and good cheer .
At the time , I <unk> three days to the <unk> <unk> of all this beer , beef , and bread , during which many profound thoughts were incidentally <unk> to me , capable of a <unk> and <unk> application ; and , <unk> , I <unk> <unk> <unk> of my own , touching the probable quantity of <unk> , <unk> . , consumed by every <unk> Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery .
In the first place , the amount of butter , and <unk> and <unk> cheese consumed , seems amazing .
I <unk> it , though , to their naturally unctuous <unk> , being <unk> still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation , and especially by their pursuing their game in those <unk> Polar Seas , on the very coasts of that <unk> country where the convivial <unk> <unk> each other in <unk> of train oil .
The quantity of beer , too , is very large , <unk> barrels .
Now , as those <unk> <unk> could only be <unk> in the short summer of that <unk> , so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen , including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea , did not much exceed three months , say , and <unk> 30 men to each of their fleet of <unk> sail , we have <unk> <unk> Dutch seamen in all ; therefore , I say , we have precisely two barrels of beer <unk> man , for a twelve weeks ’ <unk> , <unk> of his fair <unk> of that <unk> <unk> of gin .
Now , whether these gin and beer harpooneers , so <unk> as one might fancy them to have been , were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat ’ s head , and take good <unk> at flying whales ; this would seem somewhat <unk> .
Yet they did <unk> at them , and hit them too .
But this was very far North , be it remembered , where beer <unk> well with the <unk> ; upon the Equator , in our southern fishery , beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and <unk> in his boat ; and <unk> loss might <unk> to Nantucket and New Bedford .
But no more ; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high <unk> ; and that the English whalers have not <unk> so excellent an example .
For , say they , when cruising in an empty ship , if you can get nothing better out of the world , get a good dinner out of it , at least .
And this <unk> the <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> .
A <unk> in the Arsacides .
<unk> , in <unk> <unk> of the Sperm Whale , I have chiefly <unk> upon the marvels of his outer aspect ; or separately and in detail upon some few interior <unk> features .
But to a large and <unk> sweeping <unk> of him , it <unk> me now to <unk> him still further , and <unk> the points of his <unk> , <unk> his <unk> , and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones , set him before you in his <unk> ; that is to say , in his unconditional skeleton .
But how now , Ishmael ?
How is it , that you , a mere oarsman in the fishery , pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale ?
Did <unk> Stubb , mounted upon your capstan , <unk> <unk> on the anatomy of the <unk> ; and by help of the windlass , hold up a specimen rib for <unk> ?
<unk> thyself , Ishmael .
Can you land a full-grown whale on your deck for <unk> , as a cook <unk> a <unk> ?
Surely not .
A veritable <unk> have you hitherto been , Ishmael ; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone ; the privilege of <unk> upon the <unk> and beams ; the <unk> , <unk> , sleepers , and <unk> , making up the <unk> of leviathan ; and <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> in his bowels .
I confess , that since Jonah , few whalemen have <unk> very far beneath the skin of the <unk> whale ; nevertheless , I have been blessed with an opportunity to <unk> him in <unk> .
In a ship I belonged to , a small <unk> Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his <unk> or bag , to make <unk> for the barbs of the harpoons , and for the heads of the lances .
Think you I let that chance go , without using my <unk> and jack-knife , and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that young <unk> ?
And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic , full grown <unk> , for that rare knowledge I am <unk> to my late royal friend Tranquo , king of Tranque , one of the Arsacides .
For being at Tranque , years ago , when attached to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , I was invited to spend part of the <unk> <unk> with the lord of Tranque , at his retired palm <unk> at <unk> ; a <unk> <unk> not very far distant from what our sailors called <unk> , his <unk> .
Among many other fine qualities , my royal friend Tranquo , being <unk> with a devout love for all matters of barbaric <unk> , had brought together in <unk> whatever rare things the more <unk> of his people could <unk> ; chiefly carved woods of wonderful <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> spears , <unk> <unk> , <unk> canoes ; and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders , the <unk> , <unk> waves had cast upon his shores .
Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale , which , after an unusually long raging gale , had been found dead and stranded , with his head against a <unk> tree , whose <unk> , tufted <unk> seemed his <unk> jet .
When the vast body had at last been stripped of its <unk> <unk> , and the bones become dust dry in the sun , then the skeleton was carefully <unk> up the <unk> <unk> , where a grand <unk> of <unk> palms now <unk> it .
The ribs were hung with <unk> ; the vertebræ were carved with <unk> <unk> , in strange hieroglyphics ; in the skull , the priests kept up an <unk> <unk> flame , so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapory spout ; while , suspended from a <unk> , the terrific lower jaw <unk> over all the <unk> , like the <unk> sword that so affrighted <unk> .
It was a wondrous sight .
The wood was green as <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ; the trees stood high and haughty , feeling their living <unk> ; the <unk> earth beneath was as a weaver ’ s loom , with a <unk> <unk> on it , <unk> the <unk> <unk> formed the warp and woof , and the living flowers the figures .
All the trees , with all their laden branches ; all the <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> ; the <unk> air ; all these <unk> were active .
Through the <unk> of the leaves , the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the <unk> verdure .
Oh , busy weaver !
unseen weaver ! — pause ! — one word ! — <unk> <unk> the <unk> ?
what <unk> may it deck ?
wherefore all these <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> , weaver ! — stay thy hand ! — but one single word with thee !
Nay — the shuttle flies — the figures float from forth the loom ; the <unk> <unk> for ever <unk> away .
The <unk> , he <unk> ; and by that weaving is he <unk> , that he hears no mortal voice ; and by that humming , we , too , who look on the loom are <unk> ; and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it .
For even so it is in all material <unk> .
The spoken words that are <unk> among the flying <unk> ; those same words are plainly heard without the walls , bursting from the opened <unk> .
<unk> have <unk> been <unk> .
Ah , mortal !
then , be heedful ; for so , in all this din of the great world ’ s loom , thy <unk> <unk> may be <unk> afar .
Now , amid the green , <unk> loom of that <unk> wood , the great , white , <unk> skeleton lay lounging — a gigantic <unk> !
Yet , as the <unk> <unk> warp and woof <unk> and <unk> around him , the mighty <unk> seemed the cunning weaver ; himself all woven over with the <unk> ; every month <unk> <unk> , <unk> verdure ; but himself a skeleton .
Life folded Death ; Death <unk> Life ; the grim god <unk> with <unk> Life , and <unk> him <unk> <unk> .
Now , when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale , and saw the skull an altar , and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued , I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of <unk> .
He laughed .
But more I marvelled that the priests should swear that <unk> jet of his was <unk> .
To and fro I paced before this skeleton — <unk> the <unk> aside — broke through the ribs — and with a ball of <unk> twine , <unk> , <unk> long amid its many winding , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
But soon my line was out ; and following it back , I emerged from the opening where I entered .
I saw no living thing within ; naught was there but bones .
<unk> me a green <unk> , I once more dived within the skeleton .
From their <unk> in the skull , the priests perceived me taking the <unk> of the final rib , “ How now ! ” they shouted ; “ <unk> ’ st thou measure this our god !
That ’ s for us . ” “ Aye , priests — well , how long do ye make him , then ? ” But <unk> a fierce <unk> rose among them , concerning feet and inches ; they cracked each other ’ s <unk> with their <unk> — the great skull <unk> — and seizing that lucky chance , I quickly concluded my own <unk> .
These <unk> I now propose to set before you .
But first , be it recorded , that , in this matter , I am not free to utter any fancied <unk> I please .
Because there are skeleton authorities you can <unk> to , to test my <unk> .
There is a <unk> <unk> , they tell me , in <unk> , England , one of the whaling ports of that country , where they have some fine <unk> of <unk> and other whales .
Likewise , I have heard that in the <unk> of <unk> , in New <unk> , they have what the <unk> call “ the only <unk> specimen of a Greenland or <unk> Whale in the United States . ” Moreover , at a place in <unk> , England , <unk> <unk> by name , a certain Sir <unk> <unk> has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale , but of <unk> size , by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo ’ s .
In both cases , the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged , were originally <unk> by their <unk> upon similar grounds .
King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it ; and Sir <unk> , because he was lord of the <unk> of those parts .
Sir <unk> ’ s whale has been <unk> throughout ; so that , like a great chest of drawers , you can open and shut him , in all his bony <unk> — spread out his ribs like a gigantic <unk> — and swing all day upon his lower jaw .
<unk> are to be put upon some of his <unk> and <unk> ; and a <unk> will show round future <unk> with a bunch of <unk> at his side .
Sir <unk> thinks of <unk> <unk> for a peep at the <unk> <unk> in the spinal <unk> ; <unk> to hear the <unk> in the hollow of his <unk> ; and <unk> for the <unk> view from his forehead .
The skeleton <unk> I shall now proceed to set down are copied <unk> from my right arm , where I had them tattooed ; as in my wild <unk> at that period , there was no other secure way of <unk> such valuable <unk> .
But as I was <unk> for space , and <unk> the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a <unk> I was then <unk> — at least , what <unk> parts might remain — I did not trouble myself with the odd inches ; nor , indeed , should inches at all enter into a congenial <unk> of the whale .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> of The Whale ’ s <unk> .
In the first place , I wish to lay before you a particular , plain <unk> , touching the living bulk of this leviathan , whose skeleton we are <unk> to <unk> .
Such a <unk> may prove useful here .
According to a careful <unk> I have made , and which I partly base upon Captain Scoresby ’ s <unk> , of seventy tons for the largest sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length ; according to my careful <unk> , I say , a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude , between <unk> and <unk> feet in length , and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference , such a whale will weigh at least <unk> tons ; so that , <unk> <unk> men to a <unk> , he would considerably <unk> the combined <unk> of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants .
Think you not then that brains , like <unk> cattle , should be put to this leviathan , to make him at all <unk> to any landsman ’ s imagination ?
<unk> already in various ways put before you his skull , spout-hole , jaw , teeth , tail , forehead , fins , and divers other parts , I shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his <unk> bones .
But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a <unk> of the entire extent of the skeleton ; as it is by far the most complicated part ; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter , you must not fail to carry it in your mind , or under your arm , as we proceed , otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view .
In length , the Sperm Whale ’ s skeleton at Tranque measured <unk> feet ; so that when fully invested and extended in life , he must have been <unk> feet long ; for in the whale , the skeleton <unk> about one fifth in length compared with the living body .
Of this <unk> feet , his skull and jaw <unk> some twenty feet , leaving some fifty feet of plain <unk> .
<unk> to this <unk> , for something less than a third of its length , was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once <unk> his <unk> .
To me this vast <unk> chest , with the long , <unk> spine , extending far away from it in a straight line , not a little <unk> the hull of a great ship <unk> upon the <unk> , when only some twenty of her naked <unk> are inserted , and the keel is otherwise , for the time , but a long , <unk> timber .
The ribs were ten on a side .
The first , to begin from the neck , was nearly six feet long ; the second , third , and fourth were each <unk> longer , till you came to the <unk> of the fifth , or one of the middle ribs , which measured eight feet and some inches .
From that part , the remaining ribs diminished , till the tenth and last only <unk> five feet and some inches .
In general thickness , they all bore a <unk> <unk> to their length .
The middle ribs were the most arched .
In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams <unk> to lay <unk> <unk> over small <unk> .
In considering these ribs , I could not but be struck anew with the circumstance , so <unk> repeated in this book , that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form .
The largest of the Tranque ribs , one of the middle ones , occupied that part of the fish which , in life , is greatest in depth .
Now , the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet ; whereas , the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet .
So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part .
Besides , for some way , where I now saw but a naked spine , all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh , <unk> , blood , and bowels .
Still more , for the <unk> fins , I here saw but a few disordered joints ; and in place of the <unk> and majestic , but <unk> flukes , an utter blank !
How vain and foolish , then , thought I , for timid <unk> man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale , by merely <unk> over his dead <unk> skeleton , stretched in this peaceful wood .
No .
Only in the heart of <unk> perils ; only when within the <unk> of his <unk> flukes ; only on the profound <unk> sea , can the fully invested whale be truly and <unk> found out .
But the spine .
For that , the best way we can consider it is , with a <unk> , to pile its bones high up on end .
No speedy <unk> .
But now it ’ s done , it looks much like <unk> ’ s <unk> .
There are forty and odd vertebræ in all , which in the skeleton are not locked together .
They mostly lie like the great <unk> blocks on a Gothic <unk> , forming solid courses of heavy masonry .
The largest , a middle one , is in <unk> something less than three feet , and in depth more than four .
The smallest , where the spine tapers away into the tail , is only two inches in <unk> , and looks something like a white <unk> .
I was told that there were still smaller ones , but they had been lost by some little cannibal <unk> , the priest ’ s children , who had <unk> them to play <unk> with .
Thus we see how that the spine of even the <unk> of living things tapers off at last into simple child ’ s play .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Fossil Whale .
From his mighty bulk the whale <unk> a most congenial <unk> <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , and generally <unk> .
Would you , you could not <unk> him .
By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial <unk> .
Not to tell over again his <unk> from spiracle to tail , and the yards he <unk> about the waist ; only think of the gigantic <unk> of his <unk> , where they lie in him like great cables and <unk> coiled away in the subterranean <unk> of a <unk> .
<unk> I have <unk> to <unk> this Leviathan , it <unk> me to <unk> myself <unk> <unk> in the <unk> ; not <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> of his blood , and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels .
<unk> already described him in most of his present <unk> and anatomical peculiarities , it now remains to <unk> him in an <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> point of view .
<unk> to any other creature than the Leviathan — to an <unk> or a <unk> — such portly terms might <unk> be deemed <unk> <unk> .
But when Leviathan is the text , the case is <unk> .
<unk> am I to <unk> to this <unk> under the <unk> words of the <unk> .
And here be it said , that whenever it has been convenient to <unk> one in the course of these <unk> , I have invariably used a huge <unk> <unk> of Johnson , <unk> <unk> for that purpose ; because that famous <unk> ’ s uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to <unk> a <unk> to be used by a whale author like me .
One often hears of <unk> that rise and swell with their subject , though it may seem but an ordinary one .
How , then , with me , writing of this Leviathan ?
<unk> my <unk> <unk> into <unk> <unk> .
Give me a <unk> ’ s <unk> !
Give me <unk> ’ <unk> for an <unk> !
<unk> , hold my arms !
For in the mere act of <unk> my thoughts of this Leviathan , they weary me , and make me faint with their <unk> <unk> of sweep , as if to include the whole circle of the <unk> , and all the generations of whales , and men , and <unk> , past , present , and to come , with all the revolving <unk> of <unk> on earth , and throughout the whole universe , not <unk> its <unk> .
Such , and so <unk> , is the virtue of a large and <unk> <unk> !
We expand to its bulk .
To produce a mighty book , you must choose a mighty <unk> .
No great and <unk> volume can ever be written on the <unk> , though many there be who have tried it .
Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales , I present my <unk> as a <unk> , by <unk> that in my miscellaneous time I have been a <unk> , and also a great <unk> of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> of all sorts .
Likewise , by way of preliminary , I desire to <unk> the reader , that while in the earlier <unk> <unk> there are found the <unk> of monsters now almost completely <unk> ; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the <unk> <unk> seem the <unk> , or at any rate <unk> links , between the <unk> creatures , and those whose remote <unk> are said to have entered the <unk> ; all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered belong to the <unk> period , which is the last preceding the <unk> <unk> .
And though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time , they are yet sufficiently <unk> to them in general respects , to <unk> their taking <unk> as <unk> <unk> .
<unk> broken <unk> of <unk> whales , <unk> of their bones and skeletons , have within thirty years past , at various intervals , been found at the base of the <unk> , in <unk> , in France , in England , in <unk> , and in the States of <unk> , <unk> , and Alabama .
Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull , which in the year <unk> was <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in <unk> , a short street opening almost directly upon the <unk> of the <unk> ; and bones <unk> in <unk> the great docks of <unk> , in <unk> ’ s time .
Cuvier pronounced these <unk> to have belonged to some utterly unknown <unk> species .
But by far the most wonderful of all <unk> relics was the almost complete vast skeleton of an <unk> monster , found in the year <unk> , on the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , in Alabama .
The <unk> credulous <unk> in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the <unk> angels .
The Alabama doctors declared it a huge <unk> , and bestowed upon it the name of <unk> .
But some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to Owen , the English <unk> , it turned out that this alleged <unk> was a whale , though of a departed species .
A significant <unk> of the fact , again and again repeated in this book , that the skeleton of the whale <unk> but little <unk> to the shape of his fully invested body .
So Owen <unk> the monster <unk> ; and in his paper read before the London <unk> <unk> , pronounced it , in substance , one of the most extraordinary creatures which the <unk> of the globe have <unk> out of existence .
When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons , skulls , tusks , jaws , ribs , and vertebræ , all <unk> by <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> ; but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar <unk> to the <unk> <unk> Leviathans , their <unk> <unk> ; I am , by a flood , borne back to that wondrous period , ere time itself can be said to have <unk> ; for time began with man .
Here <unk> ’ s grey chaos rolls over me , and I obtain dim , shuddering <unk> into those Polar <unk> ; when <unk> <unk> of ice pressed hard upon what are now the <unk> ; and in all the <unk> miles of this world ’ s circumference , not an <unk> hand ’ s breadth of land was visible .
Then the whole world was the whale ’ s ; and , king of creation , he left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the <unk> .
Who can show a <unk> like Leviathan ?
Ahab ’ s harpoon had shed <unk> blood than the <unk> ’ s .
<unk> seems a <unk> .
I look round to shake hands with <unk> .
I am <unk> at this <unk> , <unk> existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale , which , having been before all time , must needs <unk> after all <unk> ages are over .
But not alone has this Leviathan left his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> plates of nature , and in <unk> and <unk> <unk> his ancient <unk> ; but upon Egyptian tablets , whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost <unk> character , we find the <unk> <unk> of his fin .
In an apartment of the great <unk> of <unk> , some fifty years ago , there was discovered upon the <unk> ceiling a <unk> and painted <unk> , abounding in <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , similar to the <unk> figures on the celestial globe of the <unk> .
<unk> among them , old Leviathan swam as of <unk> ; was there swimming in that <unk> , centuries before Solomon was <unk> .
Nor must there be omitted another strange <unk> of the antiquity of the whale , in his own <unk> <unk> reality , as set down by the venerable John <unk> , the old <unk> traveller .
“ Not far from the <unk> , they have a Temple , the <unk> and <unk> of which are made of <unk> ; for Whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore .
The <unk> People imagine , that by a secret <unk> bestowed by God upon the Temple , no Whale can pass it without immediate death .
But the truth of the <unk> is , that on either side of the Temple , there are <unk> that shoot two <unk> into the Sea , and wound the Whales when they light upon ’ em .
They keep a Whale ’ s <unk> of an incredible length for a <unk> , which lying upon the Ground with its <unk> part <unk> , makes an <unk> , the Head of which cannot be reached by a Man upon a <unk> ’ s Back .
This <unk> ( says John <unk> ) is said to have <unk> there a hundred <unk> before I saw it .
Their <unk> <unk> , that a Prophet who <unk> ’ d of <unk> , came from this Temple , and some do not stand to assert , that the Prophet <unk> was cast forth by the Whale at the <unk> of the Temple . ” In this <unk> Temple of the Whale I leave you , reader , and if you be a Nantucketer , and a whaleman , you will silently worship there .
CHAPTER <unk> .
Does the Whale ’ s <unk> <unk> ? — Will He <unk> ?
<unk> , then , as this Leviathan comes <unk> down upon us from the <unk> of the <unk> , it may be <unk> <unk> , whether , in the long course of his generations , he has not <unk> from the original bulk of his <unk> .
But upon <unk> we find , that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose <unk> remains are found in the <unk> system ( <unk> a distinct <unk> period prior to man ) , but of the whales found in that <unk> system , those belonging to its latter <unk> exceed in size those of its earlier ones .
Of all the <unk> whales yet <unk> , by far the largest is the Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter , and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton .
Whereas , we have already seen , that the <unk> gives <unk> feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale .
And I have heard , on whalemen ’ s authority , that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture .
But may it not be , that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous <unk> <unk> ; may it not be , that since Adam ’ s time they have <unk> ?
<unk> , we must conclude so , if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as Pliny , and the ancient naturalists generally .
For Pliny tells us of whales that embraced <unk> of living bulk , and <unk> of others which measured eight hundred feet in length — <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of Whales !
And even in the days of Banks and <unk> , <unk> ’ s naturalists , we find a <unk> member of the <unk> of <unk> setting down certain <unk> Whales ( <unk> , or <unk> <unk> ) at one hundred and twenty yards ; that is , three hundred and sixty feet .
And <unk> , the French <unk> , in his <unk> history of whales , in the very beginning of his work ( page 3 ) , sets down the Right Whale at one hundred <unk> , three hundred and <unk> feet .
And this work was published so late as A.D. <unk> .
But will any whaleman believe these stories ?
No .
The whale of to-day is as big as his <unk> in Pliny ’ s time .
And if ever I go where Pliny is , I , a whaleman ( more than he was ) , will make bold to tell him so .
Because I cannot understand how it is , that while the Egyptian <unk> that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born , do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern <unk> in his socks ; and while the cattle and other animals <unk> on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets , by the <unk> <unk> in which they are drawn , just as plainly prove that the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> cattle of <unk> , not only equal , but far exceed in magnitude the <unk> of <unk> ’ s fat <unk> ; in the face of all this , I will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have <unk> .
But still another inquiry remains ; one often agitated by the more <unk> Nantucketers .
Whether owing to the almost <unk> look-outs at the mast-heads of the whale-ships , now <unk> even through <unk> ’ s straits , and into the remotest secret drawers and <unk> of the world ; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all <unk> coasts ; the <unk> point is , whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase , and so remorseless a <unk> ; whether he must not at last be <unk> from the waters , and the last whale , like the last man , smoke his last pipe , and then himself <unk> in the final puff .
<unk> the <unk> herds of whales with the <unk> herds of buffalo , which , not forty years ago , <unk> by <unk> of thousands the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and shook their iron <unk> and <unk> with their <unk> <unk> upon the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , where now the polite <unk> <unk> you land at a <unk> an inch ; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished , to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy <unk> .
But you must look at this matter in every light .
Though so short a period ago — not a good lifetime — the census of the buffalo in <unk> <unk> the census of men now in London , and though at the present day not one horn or <unk> of them remains in all that region ; and though the cause of this wondrous <unk> was the spear of man ; yet the far different nature of the <unk> <unk> <unk> so <unk> an end to the Leviathan .
<unk> men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for <unk> months think they have done <unk> well , and thank God , if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish .
Whereas , in the days of the old <unk> and Indian hunters and <unk> of the West , when the far west ( in whose sunset <unk> still rise ) was a <unk> and a virgin , the same number of <unk> men , for the same number of months , mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships , would have slain not forty , but forty thousand and more <unk> ; a fact that , if need were , could be <unk> stated .
Nor , considered aright , does it seem any argument in <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the Sperm Whale , for example , that in former years ( the latter part of the last century , say ) these Leviathans , in small <unk> , were encountered much oftener than at present , and , in consequence , the voyages were not so prolonged , and were also much more <unk> .
Because , as has been elsewhere noticed , those whales , <unk> by some <unk> to safety , now swim the seas in immense <unk> , so that to a large degree the scattered <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and schools of other days are now <unk> into vast but widely separated , <unk> <unk> .
That is all .
And equally <unk> seems the conceit , that because the <unk> whale-bone whales no longer <unk> many grounds in former years abounding with them , hence that species also is <unk> .
For they are only being driven from promontory to <unk> ; and if one coast is no longer <unk> with their jets , then , be sure , some other and <unk> <unk> has been very recently startled by the <unk> spectacle .
<unk> : concerning these last mentioned Leviathans , they have two firm <unk> , which , in all human probability , will for ever remain impregnable .
And as upon the <unk> of their valleys , the frosty <unk> have retreated to their mountains ; so , hunted from the <unk> and <unk> of the middle seas , the whale-bone whales can at last <unk> to their Polar <unk> , and diving under the ultimate <unk> <unk> and walls there , come up among icy fields and <unk> ; and in a <unk> circle of everlasting December , bid <unk> to all pursuit from man .
But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one <unk> , some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this <unk> <unk> has already very <unk> diminished their <unk> .
But though for some time past a number of these whales , not less than <unk> , have been <unk> slain on the nor ’ west coast by the Americans alone ; yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter .
Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the <unk> of the more enormous creatures of the globe , yet what shall we say to <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , when he tells us that at one hunting the King of <unk> took <unk> elephants ; that in those <unk> elephants are numerous as <unk> of cattle in the <unk> climes .
And there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants , which have now been hunted for thousands of years , by <unk> , by <unk> , by <unk> , and by all the successive <unk> of the East — if they still survive there in great numbers , much more may the great whale <unk> all hunting , since he has a pasture to <unk> in , which is precisely twice as large as all Asia , both <unk> , Europe and Africa , New Holland , and all the <unk> of the sea combined .
Moreover : we are to consider , that from the presumed great <unk> of whales , their probably attaining the age of a century and more , therefore at any one period of time , several distinct <unk> generations must be <unk> .
And what that is , we may soon gain some idea of , by <unk> all the <unk> , <unk> , and family <unk> of creation <unk> up the live bodies of all the men , women , and children who were alive <unk> years ago ; and <unk> this countless host to the present human <unk> of the globe .
Wherefore , for all these things , we account the whale immortal in his species , however <unk> in his <unk> .
He swam the seas before the <unk> broke water ; he once swam over the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> .
In Noah ’ s flood he <unk> Noah ’ s <unk> ; and if ever the world is to be again <unk> , like the <unk> , to kill off its <unk> , then the eternal whale will still survive , and rearing upon the topmost <unk> of the equatorial flood , spout his <unk> <unk> to the skies .
CHAPTER <unk> .
Ahab ’ s Leg .
The <unk> manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel Enderby of London , had not been <unk> with some small violence to his own person .
He had lighted with such energy upon a <unk> of his boat that his ivory leg had received a <unk> shock .
And when after gaining his own deck , and his own pivot-hole there , he so <unk> <unk> round with an <unk> command to the steersman ( it was , as ever , something about his not steering <unk> enough ) ; then , the already <unk> ivory received such an additional <unk> and <unk> , that though it still remained entire , and to all appearances <unk> , yet Ahab did not <unk> it entirely <unk> .
And , indeed , it seemed small matter for wonder , that for all his <unk> , mad <unk> , Ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood .
For it had not been very long prior to the Pequod ’ s sailing from Nantucket , that he had been found one night lying <unk> upon the ground , and <unk> ; by some unknown , and seemingly inexplicable , unimaginable <unk> , his ivory limb having been so violently <unk> , that it had <unk> smitten , and all but <unk> his <unk> ; nor was it without extreme difficulty that the <unk> wound was entirely <unk> .
Nor , at the time , had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind , that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct <unk> of a former woe ; and he too plainly seemed to see , that as the most <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> his kind as <unk> as the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> ; so , equally with every <unk> , all miserable events do naturally beget their like .
Yea , more than equally , thought Ahab ; since both the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> go further than the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> .
For , not to hint of this : that it is an inference from certain <unk> <unk> , that while some natural <unk> here shall have no children born to them for the other world , but , on the contrary , shall be followed by the <unk> of all hell ’ s despair ; whereas , some guilty mortal <unk> shall still <unk> beget to themselves an eternally <unk> <unk> of <unk> beyond the grave ; not at all to hint of this , there still seems an <unk> in the deeper <unk> of the thing .
For , thought Ahab , while even the highest earthly <unk> ever have a certain <unk> <unk> lurking in them , but , at bottom , all <unk> , a mystic significance , and , in some men , an <unk> grandeur ; so do their <unk> <unk> not <unk> the obvious <unk> .
To <unk> the <unk> of these high mortal <unk> , carries us at last among the <unk> <unk> of the gods ; so that , in the face of all the glad , <unk> <unk> , and soft <unk> , round <unk> , we must needs give in to this : that the gods themselves are not for ever glad .
The <unk> , sad <unk> in the brow of man , is but the <unk> of sorrow in the <unk> .
<unk> here a secret has been <unk> , which perhaps might more properly , in set way , have been <unk> before .
With many other particulars concerning Ahab , always had it remained a mystery to some , why it was , that for a certain period , both before and after the sailing of the Pequod , he had hidden himself away with such <unk> <unk> ; and , for that one interval , sought speechless refuge , as it were , among the marble <unk> of the dead .
Captain Peleg ’ s <unk> reason for this thing appeared by no means <unk> ; though , indeed , as touching all Ahab ’ s deeper part , every <unk> <unk> more of significant darkness than of <unk> light .
But , in the end , it all came out ; this one matter did , at least .
That direful <unk> was at the bottom of his temporary <unk> .
And not only this , but to that <unk> , dropping circle ashore , who , for any reason , possessed the privilege of a less <unk> approach to him ; to that timid circle the above hinted <unk> — remaining , as it did , <unk> <unk> for by Ahab — invested itself with terrors , not entirely <unk> from the land of spirits and of <unk> .
So that , through their <unk> for him , they had all <unk> , so far as in them lay , to <unk> up the knowledge of this thing from others ; and hence it was , that not till a considerable interval had elapsed , did it <unk> upon the Pequod ’ s decks .
But be all this as it may ; let the unseen , <unk> <unk> in the air , or the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of fire , have to do or not with earthly Ahab , yet , in this present matter of his leg , he took plain practical <unk> ; — he called the carpenter .
And when that <unk> appeared before him , he bade him without <unk> set about making a new leg , and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> ( Sperm Whale ) which had thus far been <unk> on the voyage , in order that a careful <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> stuff might be secured .
This done , the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night ; and to provide all the <unk> for it , independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use .
Moreover , the ship ’ s forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary <unk> in the hold ; and , to <unk> the affair , the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the <unk> of whatever iron contrivances might be needed .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Carpenter .
<unk> thyself <unk> among the <unk> of <unk> , and take high <unk> man alone ; and he seems a wonder , a grandeur , and a woe .
But from the same point , take mankind in mass , and for the most part , they seem a mob of unnecessary <unk> , both <unk> and hereditary .
But most <unk> though he was , and far from <unk> an example of the high , <unk> <unk> ; the Pequod ’ s carpenter was no <unk> ; hence , he now comes in person on this stage .
Like all <unk> ship carpenters , and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels , he was , to a certain <unk> , practical extent , alike experienced in numerous <unk> and <unk> <unk> to his own ; the carpenter ’ s pursuit being the ancient and <unk> trunk of all those numerous <unk> which more or less have to do with wood as an <unk> material .
But , besides the application to him of the generic <unk> above , this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly <unk> in those thousand nameless mechanical <unk> continually <unk> in a large ship , upon a three or four years ’ voyage , in <unk> and <unk> seas .
For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary <unk> : — <unk> stove boats , sprung spars , <unk> the shape of <unk> oars , <unk> bull ’ s eyes in the deck , or new <unk> in the side planks , and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business ; he was moreover <unk> <unk> in all manner of <unk> <unk> , both useful and <unk> .
The one grand stage where he <unk> all his various parts so <unk> , was his <unk> ; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several <unk> , of different <unk> , and both of iron and of wood .
At all times except when whales were alongside , this bench was <unk> lashed <unk> against the rear of the <unk> .
A <unk> pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole : the carpenter <unk> it into one of his <unk> <unk> , and straightway <unk> it smaller .
A lost <unk> of strange <unk> <unk> on board , and is made a <unk> : out of clean <unk> rods of <unk> bone , and <unk> of sperm whale ivory , the carpenter makes a <unk> <unk> for it .
An oarsman <unk> his wrist : the carpenter <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
Stubb <unk> for <unk> stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar ; <unk> each oar in his big vice of wood , the carpenter <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
A sailor takes a fancy to wear <unk> <unk> : the carpenter <unk> his ears .
Another has the <unk> : the carpenter out <unk> , and clapping one hand upon his bench <unk> him be seated there ; but the poor fellow <unk> <unk> under the <unk> operation ; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice , the carpenter signs him to <unk> his jaw in that , if he would have him draw the tooth .
Thus , this carpenter was prepared at all points , and alike indifferent and without respect in all .
<unk> he accounted bits of ivory ; heads he deemed but <unk> ; men themselves he lightly held for <unk> .
But while now upon so wide a field thus <unk> accomplished and with such <unk> of <unk> in him , too ; all this would seem to <unk> some uncommon <unk> of intelligence .
But not precisely so .
For nothing was this man more remarkable , than for a certain <unk> <unk> as it were ; <unk> , I say ; for it so <unk> off into the surrounding infinite of things , that it seemed one with the general <unk> discernible in the whole visible world ; which while <unk> active in <unk> <unk> , still eternally holds its peace , and <unk> you , though you dig foundations for <unk> .
Yet was this <unk> <unk> in him , <unk> , too , as it appeared , an <unk> <unk> ; — yet was it <unk> dashed at times , with an old , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , not <unk> now and then with a certain <unk> <unk> ; such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the <unk> forecastle of Noah ’ s ark .
Was it that this old carpenter had been a <unk> <unk> , whose much rolling , to and fro , not only had gathered no <unk> ; but what is more , had <unk> off whatever small outward <unk> might have originally <unk> to him ?
He was a <unk> <unk> ; an <unk> <unk> ; <unk> as a <unk> <unk> ; living without <unk> reference to this world or the next .
You might almost say , that this strange <unk> in him involved a sort of <unk> ; for in his numerous <unk> , he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct , or simply because he had been <unk> to it , or by any <unk> of all these , even or <unk> ; but merely by a kind of <unk> and dumb , <unk> <unk> process .
He was a pure <unk> ; his brain , if he had ever had one , must have early <unk> along into the muscles of his fingers .
He was like one of those <unk> but still highly useful , _ <unk> in <unk> _ , <unk> contrivances , <unk> the <unk> — though a little swelled — of a common pocket knife ; but containing , not only blades of various <unk> , but also <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
So , if his <unk> wanted to use the carpenter for a <unk> , all they had to do was to open that part of him , and the <unk> was fast : or if for <unk> , take him up by the legs , and there they were .
Yet , as previously hinted , this <unk> , <unk> carpenter , was , after all , no mere <unk> of an <unk> .
If he did not have a common soul in him , he had a subtle something that somehow <unk> did its duty .
What that was , whether <unk> of <unk> , or a few drops of <unk> , there is no telling .
But there it was ; and there it had <unk> for now some sixty years or more .
And this it was , this same unaccountable , cunning <unk> in him ; this it was , that kept him a great part of the time <unk> ; but only like an <unk> wheel , which also <unk> <unk> ; or rather , his body was a <unk> and this <unk> on guard there , and talking all the time to keep himself awake .
CHAPTER <unk> .
Ahab and the Carpenter .
The Deck — First <unk> Watch .
( _ Carpenter standing before his <unk> , and by the light of two lanterns <unk> <unk> the ivory <unk> for the leg , which <unk> is firmly fixed in the vice .
<unk> of ivory , leather straps , <unk> , <unk> , and various <unk> of all sorts lying about the bench .
<unk> , the red flame of the forge is seen , where the blacksmith is at work . _ ) <unk> the file , and <unk> the bone !
That is hard which should be soft , and that is soft which should be hard .
So we go , who file old jaws and <unk> .
Let ’ s try another .
Aye , now , this works better ( _ sneezes _ ) .
Halloa , this bone dust is ( _ sneezes _ ) — why it ’ s ( _ sneezes _ ) — yes it ’ s ( _ sneezes _ ) — bless my soul , it won ’ t let me speak !
This is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead <unk> .
<unk> a live tree , and you don ’ t get this dust ; <unk> a live bone , and you don ’ t get it ( _ sneezes _ ) .
Come , come , you old <unk> , there , bear a hand , and let ’ s have that <unk> and <unk> ; I ’ ll be ready for them presently .
<unk> now ( _ sneezes _ ) there ’ s no <unk> to make ; that might <unk> a little ; but a mere <unk> — why it ’ s easy as making <unk> ; only I should like to put a good <unk> on .
Time , time ; if I but only had the time , I could turn him out as <unk> a leg now as ever ( _ sneezes _ ) <unk> to a lady in a parlor .
Those <unk> legs and calves of legs I ’ ve seen in <unk> windows wouldn ’ t compare at all .
They <unk> water , they do ; and of course get <unk> , and have to be <unk> ( _ sneezes _ ) with <unk> and <unk> , just like live legs .
There ; before I saw it off , now , I must call his old <unk> , and see whether the length will be all right ; too short , if anything , I guess .
Ha !
that ’ s the heel ; we are in luck ; here he comes , or it ’ s somebody else , that ’ s certain .
<unk> ( _ advancing _ ) .
( _ During the <unk> scene , the carpenter <unk> <unk> at times . _ ) Well , <unk> !
Just in time , sir .
If the captain <unk> , I will now mark the length .
Let me measure , sir .
<unk> for a leg !
good .
Well , it ’ s not the first time .
About it !
There ; keep thy finger on it .
This is a cogent vice thou hast here , carpenter ; let me feel its <unk> once .
So , so ; it does <unk> some .
Oh , sir , it will break bones — beware , beware !
No fear ; I like a good <unk> ; I like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold , man .
What ’ s <unk> about there ? — the blacksmith , I mean — what ’ s he about ?
He must be <unk> the <unk> , sir , now .
Right .
It ’ s a <unk> ; he <unk> the <unk> part .
He makes a fierce red flame there !
Aye , sir ; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work .
<unk> .
So he must .
I do <unk> it now a most meaning thing , that that old Greek , <unk> , who made men , they say , should have been a blacksmith , and animated them with fire ; for what ’ s made in fire must properly belong to fire ; and so hell ’ s probable .
How the <unk> flies !
This must be the <unk> the Greek made the <unk> of .
Carpenter , when he ’ s through with that <unk> , tell him to forge a pair of steel <unk> ; there ’ s a <unk> aboard with a <unk> pack .
Sir ?
Hold ; while <unk> is about it , I ’ ll order a complete man after a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , fifty feet high in his socks ; then , chest <unk> after the <unk> <unk> ; then , legs with <unk> to ’ em , to stay in one place ; then , arms three feet through the wrist ; no heart at all , <unk> forehead , and about a quarter of an <unk> of fine brains ; and let me see — shall I order eyes to see <unk> ?
No , but put a <unk> on top of his head to <unk> <unk> .
There , take the order , and away .
Now , what ’ s he speaking about , and who ’ s he speaking to , I should like to know ?
Shall I keep standing here ?
( _ aside _ ) .
’ Tis but indifferent <unk> to make a blind <unk> ; here ’ s one .
No , no , no ; I must have a lantern .
Ho , ho !
That ’ s it , hey ?
Here are two , sir ; one will serve my turn .
What art thou thrusting that <unk> into my face for , man ?
<unk> light is worse than presented <unk> .
I thought , sir , that you spoke to carpenter .
Carpenter ?
why that ’ s — but no ; — a very <unk> , and , I may say , an <unk> <unk> sort of business thou art in here , carpenter ; — or would ’ st thou rather work in clay ?
Sir ? — <unk> ?
clay , sir ?
That ’ s <unk> ; we leave clay to <unk> , sir .
The fellow ’ s impious !
What art thou <unk> about ?
<unk> is rather <unk> , sir .
Take the hint , then ; and when thou art dead , never bury thyself under living people ’ s noses .
Sir ? — oh !
ah ! — I guess so ; — yes — oh , dear !
Look ye , carpenter , I dare say thou <unk> thyself a right good <unk> <unk> , eh ?
Well , then , will it speak <unk> well for thy work , if , when I come to mount this leg thou <unk> , I shall nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it ; that is , carpenter , my old lost leg ; the flesh and blood one , I mean .
<unk> thou not drive that old Adam away ?
<unk> , sir , I begin to understand somewhat now .
Yes , I have heard something curious on that score , sir ; how that a dismasted man never entirely <unk> the feeling of his old spar , but it will be still <unk> him at times .
May I <unk> ask if it be really so , sir ?
It is , man .
Look , put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was ; so , now , here is only one distinct leg to the eye , yet two to the soul .
Where thou <unk> <unk> life ; there , exactly there , there to a hair , do I. Is ’ t a <unk> ?
I should <unk> call it a <unk> , sir .
Hist , then .
How dost thou know that some entire , living , thinking thing may not be <unk> and <unk> standing precisely where thou now <unk> ; aye , and standing there in thy spite ?
In thy most solitary hours , then , dost thou not fear <unk> ?
Hold , don ’ t speak !
And if I still feel the <unk> of my crushed leg , though it be now so long <unk> ; then , why <unk> not thou , carpenter , feel the fiery pains of hell for ever , and without a body ?
<unk> !
Good Lord !
<unk> , sir , if it comes to that , I must <unk> over again ; I think I didn ’ t carry a small figure , sir .
Look ye , <unk> should never <unk> <unk> . — How long before the leg is done ?
Perhaps an hour , sir .
<unk> away at it then , and bring it to me ( _ turns to go _ ) .
Oh , Life !
Here I am , proud as Greek god , and yet standing <unk> to this <unk> for a bone to stand on !
<unk> be that mortal <unk> which will not do away with <unk> .
I would be free as air ; and I ’ m down in the whole world ’ s books .
I am so rich , I could have given bid for bid with the <unk> <unk> at the <unk> of the Roman <unk> ( which was the world ’ s ) ; and yet I <unk> for the flesh in the tongue I <unk> with .
By heavens !
I ’ ll get a <unk> , and into it , and <unk> myself down to one small , <unk> <unk> .
So .
<unk> ( _ resuming his work _ ) .
Well , well , well !
Stubb knows him best of all , and Stubb always says he ’ s queer ; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer ; he ’ s queer , says Stubb ; he ’ s queer — queer , queer ; and keeps <unk> it into Mr. Starbuck all the time — queer — sir — queer , queer , very queer .
And here ’ s his leg !
Yes , now that I think of it , here ’ s his bedfellow !
has a stick of whale ’ s <unk> for a wife !
And this is his leg ; he ’ ll stand on this .
What was that now about one leg standing in three places , and all three places standing in one hell — how was that ?
Oh !
I don ’ t wonder he looked so <unk> at me !
I ’ m a sort of <unk> sometimes , they say ; but that ’ s only <unk> .
Then , a short , little old body like me , should never <unk> to <unk> out into deep waters with tall , <unk> captains ; the water <unk> you under the chin pretty quick , and there ’ s a great cry for <unk> .
And here ’ s the <unk> ’ s leg !
long and <unk> , sure enough !
Now , for most <unk> one pair of legs <unk> a lifetime , and that must be because they use them <unk> , as a <unk> old lady uses her <unk> old <unk> .
But Ahab ; oh he ’ s a hard <unk> .
Look , driven one leg to death , and <unk> the other for life , and now wears out bone legs by the cord .
Halloa , there , you <unk> !
bear a hand there with those <unk> , and let ’ s <unk> it before the resurrection fellow comes <unk> with his horn for all legs , true or false , as <unk> go round <unk> old beer barrels , to fill ’ em up again .
What a leg this is !
It looks like a real live leg , <unk> down to nothing but the <unk> ; he ’ ll be standing on this to-morrow ; he ’ ll be taking <unk> on it .
Halloa !
I almost <unk> the little <unk> <unk> , <unk> ivory , where he figures up the latitude .
So , so ; <unk> , file , and <unk> , now !
CHAPTER <unk> .
Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin .
According to usage they were <unk> the ship next morning ; and lo !
no <unk> oil came up with the water ; the casks below must have sprung a bad leak .
Much concern was shown ; and Starbuck went down into the cabin to report this <unk> affair .
* * In <unk> with any considerable quantity of oil on board , it is a regular <unk> duty to conduct a <unk> into the hold , and <unk> the casks with <unk> ; which afterwards , at <unk> intervals , is removed by the ship ’ s pumps .
<unk> the casks are sought to be kept <unk> tight ; while by the changed character of the withdrawn water , the mariners readily <unk> any serious <unk> in the precious <unk> .
Now , from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , between which lies one of the tropical <unk> from the China waters into the Pacific .
And so Starbuck found Ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him ; and another separate one representing the long <unk> coasts of the Japanese islands — <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
With his snow-white new ivory leg <unk> against the screwed leg of his table , and with a long <unk> of a jack-knife in his hand , the wondrous old man , with his back to the gangway door , was <unk> his brow , and <unk> his old courses again .
“ Who ’ s there ? ” hearing the <unk> at the door , but not turning round to it .
“ On deck !
<unk> ! ” “ Captain Ahab <unk> ; it is I.
The oil in the hold is <unk> , sir .
We must up <unk> and break out . ” “ Up <unk> and break out ?
Now that we are <unk> Japan ; <unk> here for a week to <unk> a parcel of old hoops ? ” “ <unk> do that , sir , or <unk> in one day more oil than we may make good in a year .
What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth <unk> , sir . ” “ So it is , so it is ; if we get it . ” “ I was speaking of the oil in the hold , sir . ” “ And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all .
<unk> !
Let it leak !
I ’ m all <unk> myself .
Aye !
<unk> in <unk> !
not only full of leaky casks , but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship ; and that ’ s a far worse plight than the Pequod ’ s , man .
Yet I don ’ t stop to <unk> my leak ; for who can find it in the <unk> hull ; or how hope to <unk> it , even if found , in this life ’ s howling gale ?
Starbuck !
I ’ ll not have the <unk> hoisted . ” “ What will the owners say , sir ? ” “ Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and <unk> the <unk> .
What <unk> Ahab ?
<unk> , owners ?
Thou art always <unk> to me , Starbuck , about those <unk> owners , as if the owners were my conscience .
But look ye , the only real owner of anything is its commander ; and <unk> ye , my conscience is in this ship ’ s keel . — On deck ! ” “ Captain Ahab , ” said the <unk> mate , moving further into the cabin , with a daring so strangely <unk> and <unk> that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward <unk> of itself , but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself ; “ A better man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough <unk> in a <unk> man ; aye , and in a <unk> , Captain Ahab . ” “ <unk> !
Dost thou then so much as dare to <unk> think of me ? — On deck ! ” “ Nay , sir , not yet ; I do <unk> .
And I do dare , sir — to be <unk> !
Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto , Captain Ahab ? ” Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack ( forming part of most <unk> ’ s cabin furniture ) , and pointing it towards Starbuck , exclaimed : “ There is one God that is Lord over the earth , and one Captain that is lord over the Pequod . — On deck ! ” For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate , and his fiery cheeks , you would have almost thought that he had really received the <unk> of the levelled tube .
But , <unk> his emotion , he half calmly rose , and as he quitted the cabin , paused for an instant and said : “ Thou hast <unk> , not <unk> me , sir ; but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck ; thou <unk> but laugh ; but let Ahab beware of Ahab ; beware of thyself , old man . ” “ He <unk> brave , but nevertheless <unk> ; most careful <unk> that ! ” murmured Ahab , as Starbuck disappeared .
“ What ’ s that he said — Ahab beware of Ahab — there ’ s something there ! ” Then unconsciously using the musket for a staff , with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin ; but presently the thick <unk> of his forehead <unk> , and returning the gun to the rack , he went to the deck .
“ Thou art but too good a fellow , Starbuck , ” he said lowly to the mate ; then raising his voice to the crew : “ <unk> the t ’ <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> , fore and aft ; back the <unk> ; up <unk> , and break out in the <unk> . ” It were perhaps vain to <unk> exactly why it was , that as <unk> Starbuck , Ahab thus <unk> .
It may have been a flash of <unk> in him ; or mere <unk> policy which , under the circumstance , <unk> forbade the slightest <unk> of open <unk> , however <unk> , in the important chief officer of his ship .
However it was , his orders were <unk> ; and the <unk> were hoisted .
CHAPTER <unk> .
Queequeg in His Coffin .
Upon <unk> , it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were perfectly sound , and that the leak must be further off .
So , it being calm weather , they broke out deeper and deeper , <unk> the <unk> of the huge <unk> butts ; and from that black midnight sending those gigantic <unk> into the daylight above .
So deep did they go ; and so ancient , and <unk> , and <unk> the aspect of the <unk> <unk> , that you almost looked next for some mouldy <unk> cask containing coins of Captain Noah , with copies of the posted <unk> , vainly warning the <unk> old world from the flood .
<unk> after tierce , too , of water , and bread , and beef , and <unk> of <unk> , and iron <unk> of hoops , were hoisted out , till at last the piled decks were hard to get about ; and the hollow hull <unk> under foot , as if you were <unk> over empty <unk> , and reeled and rolled in the sea like an <unk> <unk> .
<unk> was the ship as a <unk> <unk> with all <unk> in his head .
Well was it that the <unk> did not visit them then .
Now , at this time it was that my poor pagan <unk> , and fast <unk> , Queequeg , was seized with a <unk> , which brought him nigh to his endless end .
Be it said , that in this vocation of whaling , <unk> are unknown ; dignity and danger go hand in hand ; till you get to be Captain , the higher you rise the <unk> you toil .
So with poor Queequeg , who , as harpooneer , must not only face all the rage of the living whale , but — as we have elsewhere seen — mount his dead back in a rolling sea ; and finally descend into the gloom of the hold , and <unk> <unk> all day in that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> the <unk> casks and see to their <unk> .
To be short , among whalemen , the harpooneers are the <unk> , so called .
Poor Queequeg !
when the ship was about half <unk> , you should have stooped over the hatchway , and peered down upon him there ; where , stripped to his woollen drawers , the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that <unk> and <unk> , like a green <unk> <unk> at the bottom of a well .
And a well , or an <unk> , it somehow proved to him , poor pagan ; where , strange to say , for all the heat of his <unk> , he caught a terrible <unk> which <unk> into a <unk> ; and at last , after some days ’ suffering , laid him in his hammock , close to the very <unk> of the door of death .
How he wasted and wasted away in those few <unk> days , till there seemed but little left of him but his <unk> and tattooing .
But as all else in him <unk> , and his <unk> grew <unk> , his eyes , nevertheless , seemed growing <unk> and <unk> ; they became of a strange <unk> of <unk> ; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his <unk> , a wondrous <unk> to that immortal health in him which could not die , or be <unk> .
And like circles on the water , which , as they grow <unk> , expand ; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding , like the rings of <unk> .
An awe that cannot be named would <unk> over you as you sat by the side of this <unk> savage , and saw as strange things in his face , as any beheld who were <unk> when <unk> died .
For whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man , never yet was put into words or books .
And the drawing near of Death , which alike <unk> all , alike <unk> all with a last <unk> , which only an author from the dead could adequately tell .
So that — let us say it again — no dying <unk> or Greek had higher and <unk> thoughts than those , whose mysterious shades you saw <unk> over the face of poor Queequeg , as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock , and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest , and the ocean ’ s invisible <unk> lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven .
Not a man of the crew but gave him up ; and , as for Queequeg himself , what he thought of his case was <unk> shown by a curious <unk> he asked .
He called one to him in the grey morning watch , when the day was just breaking , and taking his hand , said that while in Nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood , like the rich <unk> of his native isle ; and upon inquiry , he had learned that all whalemen who died in Nantucket , were laid in those same dark canoes , and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him ; for it was not unlike the custom of his own race , who , after <unk> a dead warrior , stretched him out in his canoe , and so left him to be floated away to the <unk> archipelagoes ; for not only do they believe that the stars are isles , but that far beyond all visible <unk> , their own mild , <unk> seas , <unk> with the blue heavens ; and so form the white breakers of the milky way .
He added , that he <unk> at the thought of being buried in his hammock , according to the usual <unk> , tossed like something vile to the <unk> sharks .
No : he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket , all the more congenial to him , being a whaleman , that like a whale-boat these <unk> were without a keel ; though that involved but uncertain steering , and much <unk> <unk> the dim ages .
Now , when this strange circumstance was made known aft , the carpenter was at once commanded to do Queequeg ’ s bidding , whatever it might include .
There was some heathenish , <unk> old <unk> aboard , which , upon a long previous voyage , had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the <unk> islands , and from these dark planks the coffin was <unk> to be made .
No sooner was the carpenter <unk> of the order , than taking his rule , he <unk> with all the indifferent <unk> of his character , proceeded into the forecastle and took Queequeg ’ s measure with great <unk> , regularly <unk> Queequeg ’ s person as he shifted the rule .
“ Ah !
poor fellow !
he ’ ll have to die now , ” <unk> the Long Island sailor .
Going to his <unk> , the carpenter for <unk> sake and general reference , now <unk> measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be , and then made the <unk> permanent by cutting two <unk> at its <unk> .
This done , he <unk> the planks and his <unk> , and to work .
When the last nail was driven , and the lid duly <unk> and fitted , he lightly <unk> the coffin and went forward with it , inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction .
<unk> the <unk> but <unk> cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away , Queequeg , to every one ’ s consternation , commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him , nor was there any <unk> him ; seeing that , of all mortals , some dying men are the most <unk> ; and certainly , since they will shortly trouble us so little for <unk> , the poor fellows ought to be <unk> .
<unk> over in his hammock , Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an <unk> eye .
He then called for his harpoon , had the wooden stock drawn from it , and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the <unk> of his boat .
All by his own request , also , <unk> were then ranged round the sides within : a <unk> of fresh water was placed at the head , and a small bag of <unk> earth <unk> up in the hold at the foot ; and a piece of <unk> being rolled up for a pillow , Queequeg now <unk> to be lifted into his final bed , that he might make <unk> of its <unk> , if any it had .
He lay without moving a few minutes , then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god , Yojo .
Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between , he called for the coffin lid ( hatch he called it ) to be placed over him .
The head part turned over with a leather <unk> , and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but his <unk> countenance in view .
“ <unk> ” ( it will do ; it is easy ) , he murmured at last , and signed to be <unk> in his hammock .
But ere this was done , Pip , who had been <unk> hovering near by all this while , drew nigh to him where he lay , and with soft <unk> , took him by the hand ; in the other , holding his tambourine .
“ Poor <unk> !
will ye never have done with all this weary <unk> ?
where go ye now ?
But if the currents carry ye to those sweet <unk> where the <unk> are only beat with <unk> , will ye do one little errand for me ?
<unk> out one Pip , who ’ s now been missing long : I think he ’ s in those far <unk> .
If ye find him , then comfort him ; for he must be very sad ; for look !
he ’ s left his tambourine behind ; — I found it .
<unk> , dig , dig !
Now , Queequeg , die ; and I ’ ll beat ye your dying march . ” “ I have heard , ” murmured Starbuck , gazing down the scuttle , “ that in violent <unk> , men , all ignorance , have talked in ancient <unk> ; and that when the mystery is <unk> , it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten <unk> those ancient <unk> had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty <unk> .
So , to my fond faith , poor Pip , in this strange <unk> of his <unk> , <unk> heavenly <unk> of all our heavenly <unk> .
Where learned he that , but there ? — Hark !
he <unk> again : but more wildly now . ” “ <unk> two and two !
Let ’ s make a General of him !
Ho , where ’ s his harpoon ?
Lay it across here . — <unk> , dig , dig !
<unk> !
Oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow !
Queequeg dies game ! — mind ye that ; Queequeg dies game ! — take ye good heed of that ; Queequeg dies game !
I say ; game , game , game !
but base little Pip , he died a coward ; died all a ’ shiver ; — out upon Pip !
Hark ye ; if ye find Pip , tell all the <unk> he ’ s a <unk> ; a coward , a coward , a coward !
Tell them he jumped from a whale-boat !
I ’ d never beat my tambourine over base Pip , and hail him General , if he were once more dying here .
No , no !
<unk> upon all cowards — <unk> upon them !
Let ’ em go drown like Pip , that jumped from a whale-boat .
<unk> !
<unk> ! ” During all this , Queequeg lay with closed eyes , as if in a dream .
Pip was led away , and the sick man was <unk> in his hammock .
But now that he had apparently made every <unk> for death ; now that his coffin was proved a good fit , Queequeg suddenly <unk> ; soon there seemed no need of the carpenter ’ s box : and <unk> , when some expressed their <unk> surprise , he , in substance , said , that the cause of his sudden <unk> was this ; — at a critical moment , he had just recalled a little duty ashore , which he was leaving <unk> ; and therefore had changed his mind about dying : he could not die yet , he <unk> .
They asked him , then , whether to live or die was a matter of his own <unk> will and <unk> .
He answered , certainly .
In a word , it was Queequeg ’ s conceit , that if a man made up his mind to live , mere <unk> could not kill him : nothing but a whale , or a gale , or some violent , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of that sort .
Now , there is this <unk> difference between savage and civilized ; that while a sick , civilized man may be six months <unk> , generally speaking , a sick savage is almost <unk> again in a day .
So , in good time my Queequeg gained strength ; and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days ( but eating with a vigorous <unk> ) he suddenly leaped to his feet , threw out his arms and legs , gave himself a good stretching , <unk> a little bit , and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat , and <unk> a harpoon , pronounced himself fit for a fight .
With a wild <unk> , he now used his coffin for a <unk> ; and <unk> into it his canvas bag of clothes , set them in order there .
Many spare hours he spent , in carving the lid with all manner of <unk> figures and <unk> ; and it seemed that hereby he was striving , in his rude way , to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body .
And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and <unk> of his island , who , by those <unk> marks , had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth , and a mystical <unk> on the art of attaining truth ; so that Queequeg in his own proper person was a <unk> to <unk> ; a wondrous work in one volume ; but whose mysteries not even himself could read , though his own live heart beat against them ; and these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to <unk> away with the living <unk> <unk> they were <unk> , and so be <unk> to the last .
And this thought it must have been which <unk> to Ahab that wild exclamation of his , when one morning turning away from <unk> poor Queequeg — “ Oh , devilish <unk> of the gods ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The Pacific .
When gliding by the <unk> isles we emerged at last upon the great South Sea ; were it not for other things , I could have <unk> my dear Pacific with <unk> <unk> , for now the long <unk> of my youth was answered ; that serene ocean rolled <unk> from me a thousand leagues of blue .
There is , one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea , whose gently awful <unk> seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath ; like those <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> over the buried <unk> St. John .
And meet it is , that over these <unk> , <unk> watery <unk> and <unk> ’ <unk> of all four <unk> , the waves should rise and fall , and <unk> and flow <unk> ; for here , millions of mixed shades and shadows , drowned dreams , <unk> , reveries ; all that we call lives and souls , lie dreaming , dreaming , still ; tossing like <unk> in their <unk> ; the <unk> waves but made so by their <unk> .
To any <unk> <unk> <unk> , this serene Pacific , once beheld , must ever after be the sea of his <unk> .
It rolls the <unk> waters of the world , the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms .
The same waves <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> towns , but yesterday planted by the <unk> race of men , and <unk> the faded but still <unk> <unk> of <unk> lands , <unk> than <unk> ; while all between float <unk> of coral isles , and <unk> , endless , unknown <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
Thus this mysterious , divine Pacific <unk> the world ’ s whole bulk about ; makes all coasts one bay to it ; seems the <unk> heart of earth .
<unk> by those eternal swells , you needs must own the <unk> god , bowing your head to <unk> .
But few thoughts of <unk> stirred Ahab ’ s brain , as standing like an iron <unk> at his accustomed place beside the <unk> rigging , with one <unk> he <unk> snuffed the <unk> musk from the <unk> isles ( in whose sweet woods mild <unk> must be walking ) , and with the other <unk> <unk> the salt breath of the new found sea ; that sea in which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming .
<unk> at length upon these almost final waters , and gliding towards the Japanese cruising-ground , the old man ’ s purpose <unk> itself .
His firm lips met like the lips of a vice ; the <unk> of his forehead ’ s veins swelled like <unk> <unk> ; in his very sleep , his ringing cry ran through the <unk> hull , “ Stern all !
the White Whale spouts thick blood ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
<unk> himself of the mild , <unk> weather that now reigned in these latitudes , and in <unk> for the peculiarly active <unk> shortly to be <unk> , Perth , the <unk> , <unk> old blacksmith , had not removed his <unk> forge to the hold again , after concluding his <unk> work for Ahab ’ s leg , but still retained it on deck , fast lashed to <unk> by the <unk> ; being now almost <unk> <unk> by the headsmen , and harpooneers , and <unk> to do some little job for them ; <unk> , or <unk> , or new <unk> their various weapons and boat furniture .
Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle , all <unk> to be served ; holding <unk> , <unk> , harpoons , and lances , and <unk> watching his every <unk> movement , as he toiled .
Nevertheless , this old man ’ s was a patient hammer <unk> by a patient arm .
No <unk> , no impatience , no <unk> did come from him .
<unk> , slow , and solemn ; bowing over still further his <unk> broken back , he toiled away , as if toil were life itself , and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart .
And so it was . — Most miserable !
A peculiar walk in this old man , a certain slight but <unk> <unk> <unk> in his <unk> , had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariners .
And to the <unk> of their <unk> <unk> he had finally given in ; and so it came to pass that every one now knew the <unk> story of his wretched fate .
<unk> , and not <unk> , one bitter winter ’ s midnight , on the road running between two country towns , the blacksmith <unk> felt the deadly <unk> <unk> over him , and sought refuge in a leaning , <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> was , the loss of the <unk> of both feet .
Out of this <unk> , part by part , at last came out the four <unk> of the <unk> , and the one long , and as yet <unk> fifth act of the grief of his life ’ s <unk> .
He was an old man , who , at the age of nearly sixty , had <unk> encountered that thing in sorrow ’ s <unk> called ruin .
He had been an <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and with plenty to do ; owned a house and garden ; embraced a <unk> , <unk> , loving wife , and three <unk> , <unk> children ; every Sunday went to a <unk> church , planted in a <unk> .
But one night , under cover of darkness , and further <unk> in a most cunning <unk> , a desperate <unk> slid into his happy home , and <unk> them all of everything .
And darker yet to tell , the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this <unk> into his family ’ s heart .
It was the <unk> <unk> !
Upon the opening of that fatal <unk> , forth flew the fiend , and <unk> up his home .
Now , for prudent , most wise , and <unk> reasons , the blacksmith ’ s <unk> was in the <unk> of his <unk> , but with a separate entrance to it ; so that always had the young and loving healthy wife <unk> with no <unk> <unk> , but with vigorous <unk> , to the stout ringing of her <unk> old <unk> ’ s hammer ; whose <unk> , muffled by passing through the <unk> and walls , came up to her , not <unk> , in her <unk> ; and so , to stout <unk> ’ s iron <unk> , the blacksmith ’ s infants were rocked to <unk> .
Oh , woe on woe !
Oh , Death , why canst thou not sometimes be <unk> ?
<unk> thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him , then had the young widow had a <unk> grief , and her orphans a truly venerable , <unk> <unk> to dream of in their after years ; and all of them a <unk> <unk> .
But Death <unk> down some <unk> <unk> brother , on whose <unk> daily toil solely hung the <unk> of some other family , and left the worse than useless old man standing , till the hideous <unk> of life should make him <unk> to <unk> .
Why tell the whole ?
The blows of the <unk> hammer every day grew more and more between ; and each blow every day grew <unk> than the last ; the wife sat frozen at the window , with <unk> eyes , <unk> gazing into the <unk> faces of her children ; the <unk> fell ; the forge <unk> up with <unk> ; the house was <unk> ; the mother dived down into the long <unk> grass ; her children twice followed her thither ; and the <unk> , <unk> old man <unk> off a <unk> in <unk> ; his every woe <unk> ; his grey head a scorn to <unk> <unk> !
Death seems the only <unk> <unk> for a career like this ; but Death is only a <unk> into the region of the strange <unk> ; it is but the first <unk> to the <unk> of the immense <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> ; therefore , to the <unk> eyes of such men , who still have left in them some interior <unk> against <unk> , does the <unk> and <unk> ocean <unk> spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable , taking terrors , and wonderful , <unk> adventures ; and from the hearts of infinite <unk> , the thousand <unk> sing to them — “ Come hither , <unk> ; here is another life without the <unk> of <unk> death ; here are wonders supernatural , without dying for them .
Come hither !
bury thyself in a life which , to your now equally <unk> and <unk> , landed world , is more <unk> than death .
Come hither !
put up _ thy _ <unk> , too , within the <unk> , and come hither , till we <unk> thee ! ” <unk> to these voices , East and West , by early sunrise , and by fall of eve , the blacksmith ’ s soul <unk> , Aye , I come !
And so Perth went a-whaling .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
With <unk> beard , and <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> , about <unk> , Perth was standing between his forge and anvil , the latter placed upon an <unk> log , with one hand holding a <unk> in the coals , and with the other at his forge ’ s lungs , when Captain Ahab came along , carrying in his hand a small <unk> leathern bag .
While yet a little distance from the forge , moody Ahab paused ; till at last , Perth , withdrawing his iron from the fire , began <unk> it upon the anvil — the red mass sending off the <unk> in thick hovering <unk> , some of which flew close to Ahab .
“ Are these thy <unk> <unk> ’ s <unk> , Perth ?
they are always flying in thy wake ; birds of good omen , too , but not to all ; — look here , they burn ; but thou — thou <unk> ’ st among them without a <unk> . ” “ Because I am scorched all over , Captain Ahab , ” answered Perth , resting for a moment on his hammer ; “ I am past scorching ; not easily can ’ st thou <unk> a scar . ” “ Well , well ; no more .
Thy <unk> voice sounds too calmly , <unk> <unk> to me .
In no Paradise myself , I am impatient of all <unk> in others that is not mad .
Thou should ’ st go mad , blacksmith ; say , why dost thou not go mad ?
How can ’ st thou endure without being mad ?
Do the heavens yet hate thee , that thou can ’ st not go mad ? — What <unk> thou making there ? ” “ <unk> an old <unk> , sir ; there were seams and dents in it . ” “ And can ’ st thou make it all smooth again , blacksmith , after such hard usage as it had ? ” “ I think so , sir . ” “ And I suppose thou can ’ st <unk> almost any seams and dents ; never mind how hard the <unk> , blacksmith ? ” “ Aye , sir , I think I can ; all seams and dents but one . ” “ Look ye here , then , ” cried Ahab , <unk> advancing , and leaning with both hands on Perth ’ s shoulders ; “ look ye here — _ here _ — can ye <unk> out a <unk> like this , blacksmith , ” sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow ; “ if thou could ’ st , blacksmith , glad enough would I lay my head upon thy anvil , and feel thy <unk> hammer between my eyes .
<unk> !
Can ’ st thou <unk> this <unk> ? ” “ Oh !
that is the one , sir !
<unk> I not all seams and dents but one ? ” “ Aye , blacksmith , it is the one ; aye , man , it is <unk> ; for though thou only see ’ st it here in my flesh , it has worked down into the bone of my skull — _ that _ is all wrinkles !
But , away with child ’ s play ; no more <unk> and <unk> to-day .
Look ye here ! ” <unk> the leathern bag , as if it were full of gold coins .
“ I , too , want a harpoon made ; one that a thousand <unk> of fiends could not part , Perth ; something that will stick in a whale like his own <unk> .
There ’ s the stuff , ” flinging the <unk> upon the anvil .
“ Look ye , blacksmith , these are the gathered <unk> of the steel shoes of <unk> horses . ” “ <unk> <unk> , sir ?
Why , Captain Ahab , thou hast here , then , the best and <unk> stuff we <unk> ever work . ” “ I know it , old man ; these <unk> will <unk> together like <unk> from the melted bones of murderers .
Quick !
forge me the harpoon .
And forge me first , twelve rods for its <unk> ; then wind , and <unk> , and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and <unk> of a tow-line .
Quick !
I ’ ll blow the fire . ” When at last the twelve rods were made , Ahab tried them , one by one , by <unk> them , with his own hand , round a long , heavy iron bolt .
“ A <unk> ! ” <unk> the last one .
“ <unk> that over again , Perth . ” This done , Perth was about to begin <unk> the twelve into one , when Ahab stayed his hand , and said he would <unk> his own iron .
As , then , with regular , <unk> <unk> , he hammered on the anvil , Perth passing to him the glowing rods , one after the other , and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame , the Parsee passed silently , and bowing over his head towards the fire , seemed <unk> some <unk> or some <unk> on the toil .
But , as Ahab looked up , he slid aside .
“ What ’ s that bunch of <unk> <unk> about there for ? ” muttered Stubb , looking on from the forecastle .
“ That Parsee smells fire like a <unk> ; and smells of it himself , like a hot musket ’ s <unk> . ” At last the <unk> , in one complete rod , received its final heat ; and as Perth , to <unk> it , plunged it all <unk> into the cask of water near by , the scalding steam shot up into Ahab ’ s bent face .
“ Would ’ st thou <unk> me , Perth ? ” <unk> for a moment with the <unk> ; “ have I been but <unk> my own <unk> , then ? ” “ <unk> God , not that ; yet I fear something , Captain Ahab .
Is not this harpoon for the White Whale ? ” “ For the white fiend !
But now for the barbs ; thou must make them thyself , man .
Here are my <unk> — the best of steel ; here , and make the barbs sharp as the <unk> of the <unk> Sea . ” For a moment , the old blacksmith eyed the <unk> as though he would fain not use them .
“ Take them , man , I have no need for them ; for I now neither <unk> , <unk> , nor pray till — but here — to work ! ” <unk> at last into an <unk> shape , and welded by Perth to the <unk> , the steel soon pointed the end of the iron ; and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat , prior to <unk> them , he cried to Ahab to place the <unk> near .
“ No , no — no water for that ; I want it of the true <unk> .
<unk> , there !
Tashtego , Queequeg , Daggoo !
What say ye , pagans !
Will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb ? ” holding it high up .
A <unk> of dark <unk> replied , Yes .
Three <unk> were made in the <unk> flesh , and the White Whale ’ s barbs were then <unk> .
“ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> in <unk> <unk> ! ” <unk> howled Ahab , as the <unk> iron <unk> <unk> the <unk> blood .
Now , <unk> the spare poles from below , and <unk> one of <unk> , with the <unk> still <unk> it , Ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron .
A coil of new tow-line was then <unk> , and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass , and stretched to a great <unk> .
<unk> his foot upon it , till the rope <unk> like a <unk> , then eagerly <unk> over it , and seeing no <unk> , Ahab exclaimed , “ Good !
and now for the <unk> . ” At one extremity the rope was <unk> , and the separate spread yarns were all <unk> and woven round the socket of the harpoon ; the pole was then driven hard up into the socket ; from the lower end the rope was <unk> <unk> along the pole ’ s length , and firmly secured so , with <unk> of twine .
This done , pole , iron , and rope — like the Three Fates — remained <unk> , and Ahab <unk> <unk> away with the weapon ; the sound of his ivory leg , and the sound of the <unk> pole , both <unk> ringing along every plank .
But ere he entered his cabin , light , unnatural , <unk> , yet most <unk> sound was heard .
Oh , Pip !
thy wretched laugh , thy <unk> but <unk> eye ; all thy strange <unk> not <unk> blended with the black <unk> of the melancholy ship , and <unk> it !
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
<unk> further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising ground , the Pequod was soon all <unk> in the fishery .
Often , in mild , pleasant weather , for twelve , fifteen , eighteen , and twenty hours on the stretch , they were engaged in the boats , steadily pulling , or sailing , or <unk> after the whales , or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising ; though with but small success for their pains .
At such times , under an <unk> sun ; afloat all day upon smooth , slow heaving swells ; seated in his boat , light as a <unk> canoe ; and so <unk> <unk> with the soft waves themselves , that like <unk> <unk> they <unk> against the gunwale ; these are the times of dreamy quietude , when beholding the <unk> beauty and <unk> of the ocean ’ s skin , one <unk> the tiger heart that <unk> beneath it ; and would not willingly remember , that this <unk> <unk> but <unk> a remorseless <unk> .
These are the times , when in his whale-boat the <unk> softly feels a certain <unk> , <unk> , <unk> feeling towards the sea ; that he <unk> it as so much <unk> earth ; and the distant ship revealing only the <unk> of her masts , seems struggling forward , not through high rolling waves , but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie : as when the western <unk> ’ horses only show their erected ears , while their hidden bodies widely <unk> through the amazing verdure .
The <unk> virgin <unk> ; the mild blue <unk> ; as over these there <unk> the <unk> , the hum ; you almost swear that <unk> children lie sleeping in these <unk> , in some glad <unk> , when the flowers of the woods are <unk> .
And all this <unk> with your most mystic mood ; so that fact and fancy , <unk> meeting , <unk> , and form one <unk> whole .
Nor did such <unk> scenes , however temporary , fail of at least as temporary an effect on Ahab .
But if these secret golden <unk> did seem to open in him his own secret golden <unk> , yet did his breath upon them prove but <unk> .
Oh , <unk> <unk> !
oh , ever <unk> endless <unk> in the soul ; in ye , — though long <unk> by the dead <unk> of the <unk> life , — in ye , men yet may roll , like young horses in new morning <unk> ; and for some few <unk> moments , feel the cool <unk> of the life immortal on them .
Would to God these blessed <unk> would last .
But the <unk> , <unk> threads of life are woven by warp and woof : <unk> crossed by storms , a storm for every calm .
There is no steady <unk> progress in this life ; we do not advance through fixed <unk> , and at the last one pause : — through infancy ’ s unconscious spell , <unk> ’ s <unk> faith , <unk> ’ doubt ( the common doom ) , then <unk> , then <unk> , resting at last in <unk> ’ s pondering repose of If .
But once gone through , we trace the round again ; and are infants , boys , and men , and <unk> eternally .
Where lies the final harbor , whence we <unk> no more ?
In what <unk> <unk> sails the world , of which the <unk> will never weary ?
Where is the <unk> ’ s father hidden ?
Our souls are like those orphans whose <unk> mothers die in bearing them : the secret of our <unk> lies in their grave , and we must there to learn it .
And that same day , too , gazing far down from his boat ’ s side into that same golden sea , Starbuck lowly murmured : — “ <unk> <unk> , as ever <unk> saw in his young bride ’ s eye ! — Tell me not of thy <unk> sharks , and thy <unk> cannibal ways .
Let faith <unk> fact ; let fancy <unk> memory ; I look deep down and do believe . ” And Stubb , <unk> , with sparkling scales , leaped up in that same golden light : — “ I am Stubb , and Stubb has his history ; but here Stubb takes <unk> that he has always been jolly ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The Pequod Meets The Bachelor .
And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind , some few weeks after Ahab ’ s harpoon had been welded .
It was a Nantucket ship , the Bachelor , which had just <unk> in her last cask of oil , and bolted down her bursting hatches ; and now , in glad <unk> <unk> , was <unk> , though somewhat <unk> , sailing round among the <unk> ships on the ground , previous to pointing her prow for home .
The three men at her mast-head wore long <unk> of narrow red <unk> at their hats ; from the stern , a whale-boat was suspended , bottom down ; and hanging <unk> from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain .
<unk> , <unk> , and <unk> of all colours were flying from her rigging , on every side .
<unk> lashed in each of her three <unk> <unk> were two barrels of sperm ; above which , in her <unk> cross-trees , you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid ; and nailed to her main <unk> was a <unk> lamp .
As was afterwards learned , the Bachelor had met with the most surprising success ; all the more wonderful , for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish .
Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm , but additional <unk> casks had been <unk> for , from the ships she had met ; and these were <unk> along the deck , and in the captain ’ s and officers ’ <unk> .
Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into <unk> ; and the cabin <unk> <unk> off the broad head of an <unk> , lashed down to the floor for a <unk> .
In the forecastle , the sailors had actually <unk> and pitched their <unk> , and filled them ; it was humorously added , that the cook had clapped a head on his largest <unk> , and filled it ; that the steward had <unk> his spare <unk> and filled it ; that the harpooneers had headed the <unk> of their irons and filled them ; that indeed everything was filled with sperm , except the captain ’ s <unk> pockets , and those he reserved to thrust his hands into , in <unk> <unk> of his entire satisfaction .
As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod , the <unk> sound of enormous <unk> came from her forecastle ; and drawing still nearer , a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge <unk> , which , covered with the <unk> _ <unk> _ or stomach skin of the black fish , gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew .
On the quarter-deck , the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the <unk> girls who had <unk> with them from the <unk> <unk> ; while suspended in an <unk> boat , firmly secured aloft between the <unk> and mainmast , three Long Island <unk> , with glittering <unk> of whale ivory , were <unk> over the <unk> <unk> .
Meanwhile , others of the ship ’ s company were <unk> busy at the masonry of the try-works , from which the huge pots had been removed .
You would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed <unk> , such wild cries they raised , as the now useless <unk> and <unk> were being hurled into the sea .
Lord and master over all this scene , the captain stood erect on the ship ’ s elevated quarter-deck , so that the whole <unk> <unk> was full before him , and seemed merely <unk> for his own individual <unk> .
And Ahab , he too was standing on his quarter-deck , shaggy and black , with a stubborn gloom ; and as the two ships crossed each other ’ s wakes — one all <unk> for things passed , the other all <unk> as to things to come — their two captains in themselves <unk> the whole striking contrast of the scene .
“ Come aboard , come aboard ! ” cried the gay Bachelor ’ s commander , lifting a glass and a <unk> in the air .
“ Hast seen the White Whale ? ” <unk> Ahab in reply .
“ No ; only heard of him ; but don ’ t believe in him at all , ” said the other <unk> .
“ Come aboard ! ” “ Thou art too damned jolly .
Sail on .
Hast lost any men ? ” “ Not enough to speak of — two <unk> , that ’ s all ; — but come aboard , old hearty , come along .
I ’ ll soon take that black from your brow .
Come along , will ye ( merry ’ s the play ) ; a full ship and <unk> . ” “ How wondrous familiar is a fool ! ” muttered Ahab ; then <unk> , “ Thou art a full ship and homeward bound , thou <unk> ; well , then , call me an empty ship , and <unk> .
So go thy ways , and I will mine .
<unk> there !
<unk> all sail , and keep her to the wind ! ” And thus , while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze , the other <unk> fought against it ; and so the two vessels parted ; the crew of the Pequod looking with grave , lingering glances towards the <unk> Bachelor ; but the Bachelor ’ s men never <unk> their gaze for the lively revelry they were in .
And as Ahab , leaning over the taffrail , eyed the <unk> craft , he took from his pocket a small vial of sand , and then looking from the ship to the vial , seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together , for that vial was filled with Nantucket soundings .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> Whale .
Not seldom in this life , when , on the right side , <unk> ’ s <unk> sail close by us , we , though all <unk> before , catch somewhat of the rushing breeze , and <unk> feel our <unk> sails fill out .
So seemed it with the Pequod .
For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor , whales were seen and four were slain ; and one of them by Ahab .
It was far down the afternoon ; and when all the <unk> of the <unk> fight were done : and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky , sun and whale both <unk> died together ; then , such a <unk> and such <unk> , such <unk> <unk> curled up in that <unk> air , that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green <unk> valleys of the Manilla isles , the Spanish <unk> , <unk> turned sailor , had gone to sea , <unk> with these <unk> <unk> .
<unk> again , but only <unk> to deeper gloom , Ahab , who had <unk> off from the whale , sat intently watching his final <unk> from the now <unk> boat .
For that strange spectacle <unk> in all sperm whales dying — the turning <unk> of the head , and so <unk> — that strange spectacle , beheld of such a <unk> evening , somehow to Ahab conveyed a <unk> unknown before .
“ He turns and turns him to it , — how slowly , but how steadfastly , his <unk> and <unk> brow , with his last dying motions .
He too <unk> fire ; most faithful , broad , <unk> <unk> of the sun ! — Oh that these <unk> eyes should see these <unk> sights .
Look !
here , far <unk> ; beyond all hum of human <unk> or woe ; in these most <unk> and <unk> seas ; where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets ; where for long Chinese ages , the billows have still rolled on speechless and <unk> to , as stars that <unk> upon the <unk> ’ s unknown source ; here , too , life dies <unk> full of faith ; but see !
no sooner dead , than death <unk> round the corpse , and it heads some other way .
“ Oh , thou dark Hindoo half of nature , who of drowned bones hast <unk> thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these <unk> seas ; thou art an infidel , thou <unk> , and too truly <unk> to me in the <unk> Typhoon , and the <unk> <unk> of its after calm .
Nor has this thy whale <unk> turned his dying head , and then gone round again , without a lesson to me .
“ Oh , <unk> <unk> and welded <unk> of power !
Oh , high <unk> , <unk> jet ! — that one <unk> , this one <unk> all in vain !
In vain , oh whale , dost thou seek <unk> with yon <unk> sun , that only calls forth life , but gives it not again .
Yet dost thou , darker half , rock me with a <unk> , if a darker faith .
All thy <unk> <unk> float beneath me here ; I am <unk> by breaths of once living things , <unk> as air , but water now .
“ Then hail , for ever hail , O sea , in whose eternal <unk> the wild fowl finds his only rest .
<unk> of earth , yet <unk> by the sea ; though hill and valley <unk> me , ye billows are my <unk> ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The Whale Watch .
The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart ; one , far to windward ; one , less distant , to leeward ; one ahead ; one astern .
These last three were brought alongside ere <unk> ; but the windward one could not be reached till morning ; and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night ; and that boat was Ahab ’ s .
The <unk> was thrust upright into the dead whale ’ s spout-hole ; and the lantern hanging from its top , cast a troubled <unk> <unk> upon the black , <unk> back , and far out upon the midnight waves , which gently <unk> the whale ’ s broad flank , like soft surf upon a beach .
Ahab and all his boat ’ s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee ; who <unk> in the bow , sat watching the sharks , that <unk> <unk> round the whale , and <unk> the light cedar planks with their tails .
A sound like the <unk> in <unk> over <unk> of <unk> ghosts of <unk> , ran shuddering through the air .
<unk> from his <unk> , Ahab , face to face , saw the Parsee ; and <unk> round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a <unk> world .
“ I have <unk> it again , ” said he .
“ Of the <unk> ?
Have I not said , old man , that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine ? ” “ And who are <unk> that die on the sea ? ” “ But I said , old man , that ere thou <unk> die on this voyage , two <unk> must <unk> be seen by thee on the sea ; the first not made by mortal hands ; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in America . ” “ Aye , aye !
a strange sight that , Parsee : — a hearse and its <unk> floating over the ocean with the waves for the <unk> .
Ha !
Such a sight we shall not soon see . ” “ <unk> it or not , thou canst not die till it be seen , old man . ” “ And what was that saying about thyself ? ” “ Though it come to the last , I shall still go before thee thy pilot . ” “ And when thou art so gone before — if that ever <unk> — then ere I can follow , thou must still appear to me , to pilot me still ? — Was it not so ?
Well , then , did I believe all ye say , oh my pilot !
I have here two <unk> that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it . ” “ Take another <unk> , old man , ” said the Parsee , as his eyes lighted up like <unk> in the gloom — “ <unk> only can kill thee . ” “ The gallows , ye mean . — I am immortal then , on land and on sea , ” cried Ahab , with a laugh of <unk> ; — “ <unk> on land and on sea ! ” Both were silent again , as one man .
The grey dawn came on , and the <unk> crew <unk> from the boat ’ s bottom , and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
The season for the Line at length drew near ; and every day when Ahab , coming from his cabin , cast his eyes aloft , the <unk> helmsman would <unk> handle his <unk> , and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces , and would stand there with all their eyes <unk> fixed on the nailed doubloon ; impatient for the order to point the ship ’ s prow for the equator .
In good time the order came .
It was hard upon high noon ; and Ahab , seated in the bows of his <unk> boat , was about taking his <unk> daily observation of the sun to <unk> his latitude .
Now , in that Japanese sea , the days in summer are as <unk> of <unk> .
That <unk> vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing <unk> of the <unk> ocean ’ s <unk> <unk> .
The sky looks <unk> ; clouds there are none ; the horizon floats ; and this <unk> of <unk> <unk> is as the insufferable <unk> of God ’ s throne .
Well that Ahab ’ s quadrant was furnished with <unk> glasses , through which to take sight of that <unk> fire .
So , swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship , and with his <unk> <unk> placed to his eye , he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise <unk> .
Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed , the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship ’ s deck , and with face thrown up like Ahab ’ s , was eyeing the same sun with him ; only the <unk> of his eyes half hooded their <unk> , and his wild face was <unk> to an earthly <unk> .
At length the desired observation was taken ; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg , Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant .
Then falling into a moment ’ s <unk> , he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself : “ Thou <unk> !
thou high and mighty <unk> !
thou <unk> me truly where I _ am _ — but canst thou cast the least hint where I _ shall _ be ?
Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living ?
Where is Moby Dick ?
This instant thou must be eyeing him .
These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him ; aye , and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown , thither side of thee , thou sun ! ” Then gazing at his quadrant , and <unk> , one after the other , its numerous <unk> contrivances , he pondered again , and muttered : “ <unk> <unk> !
<unk> ’ <unk> of haughty <unk> , and <unk> , and Captains ; the world <unk> of thee , of thy cunning and might ; but what after all canst thou do , but tell the poor , <unk> point , where thou thyself <unk> to be on this wide <unk> , and the hand that holds thee : no !
not one jot more !
Thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one <unk> of sand will be to-morrow noon ; and yet with thy <unk> thou <unk> the sun !
<unk> !
<unk> thee , thou vain <unk> ; and cursed be all the things that cast man ’ s eyes aloft to that heaven , whose live <unk> but <unk> him , as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light , O sun !
<unk> by nature to this earth ’ s horizon are the glances of man ’ s eyes ; not shot from the crown of his head , as if God had meant him to gaze on his <unk> .
<unk> thee , thou quadrant ! ” dashing it to the deck , “ no longer will I <unk> my earthly way by thee ; the level ship ’ s compass , and the level <unk> , by log and by line ; _ these _ shall conduct me , and show me my place on the sea .
Aye , ” <unk> from the boat to the deck , “ thus I <unk> on thee , thou <unk> thing that <unk> <unk> on high ; thus I split and destroy thee ! ” As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus <unk> with his live and dead feet , a <unk> <unk> that seemed meant for Ahab , and a <unk> despair that seemed meant for himself — these passed over the <unk> , motionless Parsee ’ s face .
<unk> he rose and glided away ; while , <unk> by the aspect of their commander , the seamen <unk> together on the forecastle , till Ahab , <unk> pacing the deck , shouted out — “ To the braces !
Up helm ! — square in ! ” In an instant the yards swung round ; and as the ship <unk> upon her heel , her three <unk> <unk> masts <unk> <unk> upon her long , ribbed hull , seemed as the three <unk> <unk> on one sufficient steed .
Standing between the <unk> , Starbuck watched the Pequod ’ s tumultuous way , and Ahab ’ s also , as he went <unk> along the deck .
“ I have sat before the dense <unk> fire and watched it all <unk> , full of its tormented flaming life ; and I have seen it <unk> at last , down , down , to <unk> dust .
Old man of oceans !
of all this fiery life of thine , what will at length remain but one little <unk> of ashes ! ” “ Aye , ” cried Stubb , “ but <unk> ashes — mind ye that , Mr. Starbuck — <unk> , not your common <unk> .
Well , well ; I heard Ahab <unk> , ‘ Here some one <unk> these <unk> into these old hands of mine ; <unk> that I must play them , and no others . ’ And <unk> me , Ahab , but thou <unk> right ; live in the game , and die in it ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
<unk> climes but <unk> the <unk> <unk> : the tiger of <unk> <unk> in <unk> groves of <unk> verdure .
<unk> the most <unk> but basket the <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> knows <unk> that never swept tame northern lands .
So , too , it is , that in these <unk> Japanese seas the mariner <unk> the <unk> of all storms , the Typhoon .
It will sometimes burst from out that <unk> sky , like an <unk> <unk> upon a <unk> and sleepy town .
Towards evening of that day , the Pequod was torn of her canvas , and <unk> was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly ahead .
When darkness came on , sky and sea roared and split with the thunder , and <unk> with the lightning , that showed the <unk> masts <unk> here and there with the <unk> which the first fury of the tempest had left for its after <unk> .
<unk> by a shroud , Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck ; at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft , to see what additional <unk> might have <unk> the <unk> <unk> there ; while Stubb and Flask were <unk> the men in the higher hoisting and <unk> lashing of the boats .
But all their pains seemed naught .
Though lifted to the very top of the <unk> , the windward quarter boat ( Ahab ’ s ) did not escape .
A great rolling sea , dashing high up against the reeling ship ’ s high <unk> side , stove in the boat ’ s bottom at the stern , and left it again , all dripping through like a <unk> .
“ <unk> work , bad work !
Mr. Starbuck , ” said Stubb , regarding the wreck , “ but the sea will have its way .
Stubb , for one , can ’ t fight it .
You see , Mr. Starbuck , a wave has such a great long start before it leaps , all round the world it runs , and then comes the spring !
But as for me , all the start I have to meet it , is just across the deck here .
But never mind ; it ’ s all in fun : so the old song says ; ” — ( _ <unk> _ . )
Oh !
jolly is the gale , And a <unk> is the whale , A ’ <unk> ’ his tail , — Such a funny , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> lad , is the Ocean , oh !
The scud all a <unk> ’ , That ’ s his flip only <unk> ’ ; When he <unk> in the <unk> ’ , — Such a funny , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> lad , is the Ocean , oh !
Thunder <unk> the ships , But he only <unk> his lips , A <unk> ’ of this flip , — Such a funny , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> lad , is the Ocean , oh !
“ Avast Stubb , ” cried Starbuck , “ let the Typhoon sing , and strike his <unk> here in our rigging ; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy peace . ” “ But I am not a brave man ; never said I was a brave man ; I am a coward ; and I sing to keep up my spirits .
And I tell you what it is , Mr. Starbuck , there ’ s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat .
And when that ’ s done , ten to one I sing ye the <unk> for a <unk> . ” “ <unk> !
look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own . ” “ What !
how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else , never mind how foolish ? ” “ Here ! ” cried Starbuck , seizing Stubb by the shoulder , and pointing his hand towards the weather bow , “ <unk> thou not that the gale comes from the eastward , the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick ?
the very course he swung to this day noon ?
now mark his boat there ; where is that stove ?
In the <unk> , man ; where he is wont to stand — his <unk> is stove , man !
Now jump overboard , and sing away , if thou must !
“ I don ’ t half understand ye : what ’ s in the wind ? ” “ Yes , yes , round the Cape of Good Hope is the <unk> way to Nantucket , ” soliloquized Starbuck suddenly , <unk> of Stubb ’ s question .
“ The gale that now hammers at us to stave us , we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home .
<unk> , to windward , all is blackness of doom ; but to leeward , homeward — I see it <unk> up there ; but not with the lightning . ” At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness , following the flashes , a voice was heard at his side ; and almost at the same instant a <unk> of thunder <unk> rolled overhead .
“ Who ’ s there ? ” “ Old Thunder ! ” said Ahab , groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivot-hole ; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by <unk> lances of fire .
Now , as the lightning rod to a <unk> on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil ; so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast , is intended to conduct it into the water .
But as this <unk> must descend to considerable depth , that its end may avoid all contact with the hull ; and as moreover , if kept <unk> towing there , it would be <unk> to many <unk> , besides <unk> not a little with some of the rigging , and more or less <unk> the vessel ’ s way in the water ; because of all this , the lower parts of a ship ’ s <unk> are not always overboard ; but are generally made in long slender links , so as to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside , or thrown down into the sea , as occasion may require .
“ The rods !
the rods ! ” cried Starbuck to the crew , suddenly <unk> to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting <unk> , to light Ahab to his post .
“ Are they overboard ?
drop them over , fore and aft .
Quick ! ” “ Avast ! ” cried Ahab ; “ let ’ s have fair play here , though we be the <unk> side .
Yet I ’ ll <unk> to raise rods on the <unk> and Andes , that all the world may be secured ; but out on <unk> !
Let them be , sir . ” “ Look aloft ! ” cried Starbuck .
“ The corpusants !
the corpusants ! ” All the <unk> were <unk> with a <unk> fire ; and touched at each <unk> <unk> with three tapering white flames , each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that <unk> air , like three gigantic <unk> tapers before an altar .
“ Blast the boat !
let it go ! ” cried Stubb at this instant , as a <unk> sea heaved up under his own little craft , so that its gunwale violently <unk> his hand , as he was passing a lashing .
“ Blast it ! ” — but slipping backward on the deck , his uplifted eyes caught the flames ; and immediately <unk> his tone he cried — “ The corpusants have mercy on us all ! ” To sailors , <unk> are household words ; they will swear in the trance of the calm , and in the teeth of the tempest ; they will <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , when most they <unk> over to a <unk> sea ; but in all my <unk> , seldom have I heard a common oath when God ’ s burning finger has been laid on the ship ; when His “ <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ” has been woven into the shrouds and the <unk> .
While this <unk> was burning aloft , few words were heard from the enchanted crew ; who in one thick <unk> stood on the forecastle , all their eyes <unk> in that pale <unk> , like a far away <unk> of stars .
<unk> against the <unk> light , the gigantic jet negro , Daggoo , loomed up to thrice his real <unk> , and seemed the black <unk> from which the thunder had come .
The parted mouth of Tashtego revealed his <unk> teeth , which strangely gleamed as if they too had been <unk> by corpusants ; while <unk> up by the preternatural light , Queequeg ’ s tattooing burned like <unk> blue flames on his body .
The <unk> all <unk> at last with the <unk> aloft ; and once more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a <unk> .
A moment or two passed , when Starbuck , going forward , pushed against some one .
It was Stubb .
“ What <unk> thou now , man ; I heard thy cry ; it was not the same in the song . ” “ No , no , it wasn ’ t ; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all ; and I hope they will , still .
But do they only have mercy on long faces ? — have they no bowels for a laugh ?
And look ye , Mr. Starbuck — but it ’ s too dark to look .
<unk> me , then : I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign of good luck ; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be <unk> a ’ block with <unk> , d ’ ye see ; and so , all that sperm will work up into the masts , like <unk> in a tree .
Yes , our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti candles — that ’ s the good promise we saw . ” At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb ’ s face slowly beginning to <unk> into sight .
<unk> upwards , he cried : “ See !
see ! ” and once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed <unk> <unk> in their pallor .
“ The corpusants have mercy on us all , ” cried Stubb , again .
At the base of the mainmast , full beneath the doubloon and the flame , the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab ’ s front , but with his head bowed away from him ; while near by , from the arched and <unk> rigging , where they had just been engaged securing a spar , a number of the seamen , <unk> by the <unk> , now <unk> together , and hung <unk> , like a knot of <unk> <unk> from a drooping , <unk> <unk> .
In various enchanted attitudes , like the standing , or stepping , or running skeletons in <unk> , others remained rooted to the deck ; but all their eyes <unk> .
“ Aye , aye , men ! ” cried Ahab .
“ Look up at it ; mark it well ; the white flame but lights the way to the White Whale !
Hand me those mainmast links there ; I would fain feel this <unk> , and let mine beat against it ; blood against fire !
So . ” Then turning — the last <unk> held fast in his left hand , he put his foot upon the Parsee ; and with fixed upward eye , and <unk> right arm , he stood erect before the lofty <unk> <unk> of flames .
“ Oh !
thou clear spirit of clear fire , whom on these seas I as Persian once did worship , till in the <unk> act so burned by thee , that to this hour I bear the scar ; I now know thee , thou clear spirit , and I now know that thy right worship is <unk> .
To neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind ; and <unk> ’ <unk> for hate thou canst but kill ; and all are killed .
No fearless fool now <unk> thee .
I own thy speechless , <unk> power ; but to the last <unk> of my <unk> life will <unk> its unconditional , <unk> <unk> in me .
In the midst of the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> stands here .
Though but a point at best ; <unk> ’ er I came ; <unk> ’ er I go ; yet while I earthly live , the <unk> <unk> lives in me , and feels her royal rights .
But war is <unk> , and hate is woe .
Come in thy <unk> form of love , and I will <unk> and <unk> thee ; but at thy highest , come as mere <unk> power ; and though thou <unk> navies of <unk> worlds , there ’ s that in here that still remains indifferent .
Oh , thou clear spirit , of thy fire thou <unk> me , and like a true child of fire , I breathe it back to thee . ” <unk> _ <unk> , repeated flashes of lightning ; the nine flames leap lengthwise to thrice their previous height ; Ahab , with the rest , <unk> his eyes , his right hand pressed hard upon them . _ <unk> “ I own thy speechless , <unk> power ; said I not so ?
Nor was it <unk> from me ; nor do I now drop these links .
Thou canst blind ; but I can then <unk> .
Thou canst <unk> ; but I can then be ashes .
Take the homage of these poor eyes , and <unk> .
I would not take it .
The lightning flashes through my skull ; mine <unk> <unk> and <unk> ; my whole <unk> brain seems as beheaded , and rolling on some <unk> ground .
Oh , oh !
Yet <unk> , yet will I talk to thee .
<unk> though thou be , thou <unk> out of darkness ; but I am darkness leaping out of light , leaping out of thee !
The <unk> <unk> ; open eyes ; see , or not ?
There burn the flames !
Oh , thou <unk> !
now I do glory in my <unk> .
But thou art but my fiery father ; my sweet mother , I know not .
Oh , cruel !
what hast thou done with her ?
There lies my <unk> ; but thine is greater .
Thou knowest not how came ye , hence <unk> thyself <unk> ; certainly knowest not thy beginning , hence <unk> thyself <unk> .
I know that of me , which thou knowest not of thyself , oh , thou omnipotent .
There is some <unk> thing beyond thee , thou clear spirit , to whom all thy <unk> is but time , all thy <unk> mechanical .
Through thee , thy flaming self , my scorched eyes do dimly see it .
Oh , thou <unk> fire , thou <unk> immemorial , thou too hast thy <unk> <unk> , thy <unk> grief .
Here again with haughty agony , I read my <unk> .
<unk> !
leap up , and <unk> the sky !
I leap with thee ; I burn with thee ; would fain be welded with thee ; <unk> I worship thee ! ” “ The boat !
the boat ! ” cried Starbuck , “ look at thy boat , old man ! ” Ahab ’ s harpoon , the one forged at Perth ’ s fire , remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch , so that it <unk> beyond his whale-boat ’ s bow ; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather <unk> to drop off ; and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale , forked fire .
As the silent harpoon burned there like a <unk> ’ s tongue , Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm — “ God , God is against thee , old man ; <unk> !
’ tis an ill voyage !
ill <unk> , ill continued ; let me square the yards , while we may , old man , and make a fair wind of it <unk> , to go on a better voyage than this . ” <unk> Starbuck , the <unk> crew instantly ran to the braces — though not a sail was left aloft .
For the moment all the aghast mate ’ s thoughts seemed theirs ; they raised a half <unk> cry .
But dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck , and snatching the burning harpoon , Ahab waved it like a <unk> among them ; swearing to <unk> with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope ’ s end .
<unk> by his aspect , and still more <unk> from the fiery dart that he held , the men fell back in dismay , and Ahab again spoke : — “ All your <unk> to hunt the White Whale are as <unk> as mine ; and heart , soul , and body , lungs and life , old Ahab is bound .
And that ye may know to what <unk> this heart <unk> ; look ye here ; thus I blow out the last fear ! ” And with one blast of his breath he <unk> the flame .
As in the <unk> that <unk> the plain , men fly the <unk> of some lone , gigantic <unk> , whose very height and strength but render it so much the more <unk> , because so much the more a mark for <unk> ; so at those last words of Ahab ’ s many of the mariners did run from him in a terror of dismay .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Deck Towards the <unk> of the First <unk> Watch .
_ Ahab standing by the helm .
Starbuck approaching him . _ “ We must send down the <unk> yard , sir .
The band is working loose and the lee lift is <unk> .
Shall I strike it , sir ? ” “ Strike nothing ; lash it .
If I had <unk> poles , I ’ d sway them up now . ” “ Sir ! — in God ’ s name ! — sir ? ” “ Well . ” “ The anchors are working , sir .
Shall I get them <unk> ? ” “ Strike nothing , and <unk> nothing , but lash everything .
The wind rises , but it has not got up to my <unk> yet .
Quick , and see to it . — By masts and keels !
he takes me for the <unk> <unk> of some <unk> <unk> .
<unk> down my <unk> yard !
Ho , <unk> !
<unk> <unk> were made for <unk> winds , and this <unk> of mine now sails amid the <unk> .
Shall I strike that ?
Oh , none but cowards send down their <unk> in tempest time .
What a <unk> aloft there !
I would <unk> ’ <unk> take it for sublime , did I not know that the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
Oh , take <unk> , take <unk> ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
Midnight . — The Forecastle <unk> .
_ Stubb and Flask mounted on them , and passing additional <unk> over the anchors there hanging . _ “ No , Stubb ; you may pound that knot there as much as you please , but you will never pound into me what you were just now saying .
And how long ago is it since you said the very contrary ?
Didn ’ t you once say that whatever ship Ahab sails in , that ship should pay something extra on its <unk> policy , just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of <unk> forward ?
Stop , now ; didn ’ t you say so ? ” “ Well , suppose I did ?
What then ?
I ’ ve part changed my flesh since that time , why not my mind ?
Besides , <unk> we _ are _ loaded with powder barrels aft and <unk> forward ; how the devil could the <unk> get <unk> in this <unk> spray here ?
Why , my little man , you have pretty red hair , but you couldn ’ t get <unk> now .
<unk> yourself ; you ’ re <unk> , or the <unk> , Flask ; might fill <unk> at your coat <unk> .
Don ’ t you see , then , that for these extra <unk> the <unk> <unk> companies have extra <unk> ?
Here are <unk> , Flask .
But <unk> , again , and I ’ ll answer ye the other thing .
First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here , though , so I can pass the rope ; now listen .
What ’ s the mighty difference between holding a mast ’ s <unk> in the storm , and standing close by a mast that hasn ’ t got any <unk> at all in a storm ?
Don ’ t you see , you <unk> , that no harm can come to the holder of the rod , unless the mast is first struck ?
What are you talking about , then ?
Not one ship in a hundred carries rods , and Ahab , — aye , man , and all of us , — were in no more danger then , in my poor opinion , than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas .
Why , you King-Post , you , I suppose you would have every man in the world go about with a small <unk> running up the corner of his hat , like a <unk> officer ’ s <unk> <unk> , and <unk> behind like his <unk> .
Why don ’ t ye be sensible , Flask ?
it ’ s easy to be sensible ; why don ’ t ye , then ?
any man with half an eye can be sensible . ” “ I don ’ t know that , Stubb .
You sometimes find it rather hard . ” “ Yes , when a fellow ’ s <unk> through , it ’ s hard to be sensible , that ’ s a fact .
And I am about <unk> with this spray .
Never mind ; catch the turn there , and pass it .
<unk> to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again .
<unk> these two anchors here , Flask , seems like <unk> a man ’ s hands behind him .
And what big generous hands they are , to be sure .
These are your iron <unk> , hey ?
What a hold they have , too !
I wonder , Flask , whether the world is <unk> anywhere ; if she is , she swings with an uncommon long cable , though .
There , hammer that knot down , and we ’ ve done .
So ; next to touching land , <unk> on deck is the most <unk> .
I say , just <unk> out my jacket <unk> , will ye ?
<unk> ye .
They laugh at <unk> so , Flask ; but seems to me , a long <unk> coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat .
The tails tapering down that way , serve to carry off the water , d ’ ye see .
<unk> with <unk> hats ; the <unk> form <unk> <unk> , Flask .
No more <unk> and <unk> for me ; I must mount a <unk> , and drive down a beaver ; so .
Halloa !
<unk> !
there goes my <unk> overboard ; Lord , Lord , that the winds that come from heaven should be so <unk> !
This is a <unk> night , lad . ” CHAPTER <unk> .
Midnight Aloft . — Thunder and <unk> .
_ The <unk> yard _ . — _ Tashtego passing new <unk> around it _ .
“ <unk> , um , um .
Stop that thunder !
<unk> too much thunder up here .
What ’ s the use of thunder ?
<unk> , um , um .
We don ’ t want thunder ; we want <unk> ; give us a glass of <unk> .
<unk> , um , um ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
During the most violent <unk> of the Typhoon , the man at the Pequod ’ s <unk> tiller had several times been <unk> hurled to the deck by its <unk> motions , even though <unk> tackles had been attached to it — for they were <unk> — because some play to the tiller was indispensable .
In a severe gale like this , while the ship is but a tossed <unk> to the blast , it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses , at intervals , go round and round .
It was thus with the Pequod ’ s ; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the <unk> ; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion .
Some hours after midnight , the Typhoon <unk> so much , that through the <unk> <unk> of Starbuck and Stubb — one engaged forward and the other aft — the shivered <unk> of the <unk> and fore and <unk> were cut adrift from the spars , and went eddying away to leeward , like the <unk> of an albatross , which sometimes are cast to the winds when that <unk> bird is on the wing .
The three corresponding new sails were now bent and <unk> , and a <unk> was set further aft ; so that the ship soon went through the water with some <unk> again ; and the course — for the present , <unk> — which he was to steer , if practicable , was once more given to the helmsman .
For during the violence of the gale , he had only steered according to its vicissitudes .
But as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible , watching the compass meanwhile , lo !
a good sign !
the wind seemed coming round astern ; aye , the foul breeze became fair !
Instantly the yards were <unk> , to the lively song of “ _ Ho !
the fair wind !
<unk> , <unk> men ! _ ” the crew singing for joy , that so promising an event should so soon have <unk> the evil portents preceding it .
In compliance with the standing order of his commander — to report immediately , and at any one of the <unk> hours , any decided change in the affairs of the deck , — Starbuck had no sooner <unk> the yards to the breeze — however <unk> and <unk> , — than he mechanically went below to <unk> Captain Ahab of the circumstance .
Ere knocking at his <unk> , he involuntarily paused before it a moment .
The cabin lamp — taking long swings this way and that — was burning <unk> , and casting <unk> shadows upon the old man ’ s bolted door , — a thin one , with fixed blinds inserted , in place of upper <unk> .
The isolated <unk> of the cabin made a certain humming silence to <unk> there , though it was <unk> round by all the roar of the elements .
The loaded muskets in the rack were <unk> revealed , as they stood upright against the forward <unk> .
Starbuck was an honest , upright man ; but out of Starbuck ’ s heart , at that instant when he saw the muskets , there strangely <unk> an evil thought ; but so <unk> with its <unk> or good <unk> that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself .
“ He would have shot me once , ” he murmured , “ yes , there ’ s the very musket that he pointed at me ; — that one with the <unk> stock ; let me touch it — lift it .
<unk> , that I , who have handled so many deadly lances , strange , that I should shake so now .
<unk> ?
I must see .
Aye , aye ; and powder in the <unk> ; — that ’ s not good .
<unk> <unk> it ? — wait .
I ’ ll <unk> myself of this .
I ’ ll hold the musket boldly while I think . — I come to report a fair wind to him .
But how fair ?
<unk> for death and doom , — _ that ’ s _ fair for Moby Dick .
It ’ s a fair wind that ’ s only fair for that accursed fish . — The very tube he pointed at me ! — the very one ; _ this _ one — I hold it here ; he would have killed me with the very thing I handle now . — Aye and he would fain kill all his crew .
Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale ?
Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant ?
and in these same perilous seas , <unk> he not his way by mere dead <unk> of the <unk> log ?
and in this very Typhoon , did he not swear that he would have no <unk> ?
But shall this <unk> old man be <unk> <unk> to drag a whole ship ’ s company down to doom with him ? — Yes , it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more , if this ship come to any deadly harm ; and come to deadly harm , my soul <unk> this ship will , if Ahab have his way .
If , then , he were this instant — put aside , that <unk> would not be his .
Ha !
is he muttering in his sleep ?
Yes , just there , — in there , he ’ s sleeping .
<unk> ?
aye , but still alive , and soon awake again .
I can ’ t withstand thee , then , old man .
Not <unk> ; not <unk> ; not <unk> wilt thou <unk> to ; all this thou <unk> .
<unk> obedience to thy own flat <unk> , this is all thou <unk> .
Aye , and say ’ st the men have vow ’ d thy vow ; say ’ st all of us are <unk> .
Great God <unk> ! — But is there no other way ?
no <unk> way ? — <unk> him a <unk> to be taken home ?
What !
hope to <unk> this old man ’ s living power from his own living hands ?
Only a fool would try it .
Say he were <unk> even ; knotted all over with ropes and <unk> ; <unk> down to <unk> on this cabin floor ; he would be more hideous than a <unk> tiger , then .
I could not endure the sight ; could not possibly fly his <unk> ; all comfort , sleep itself , <unk> reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage .
What , then , remains ?
The land is hundreds of leagues away , and locked Japan the nearest .
I stand alone here upon an open sea , with two oceans and a whole continent between me and law . — Aye , aye , ’ tis so . — Is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a <unk> murderer in his bed , <unk> sheets and skin together ? — And would I be a murderer , then , if ” — and slowly , <unk> , and half sideways looking , he placed the loaded musket ’ s end against the door .
“ On this level , Ahab ’ s hammock swings within ; his head this way .
A touch , and Starbuck may survive to <unk> his wife and child again . — Oh Mary !
Mary ! — boy !
boy !
boy ! — But if I wake thee not to death , old man , who can tell to what <unk> deeps Starbuck ’ s body this day week may sink , with all the crew !
Great God , where art Thou ?
Shall I ?
shall I ? — The wind has gone down and shifted , sir ; the fore and main <unk> are <unk> and set ; she heads her course . ” “ Stern all !
Oh Moby Dick , I clutch thy heart at last ! ” Such were the sounds that now came <unk> from out the old man ’ s tormented sleep , as if Starbuck ’ s voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak .
The yet levelled musket shook like a <unk> ’ s arm against the <unk> ; Starbuck seemed <unk> with an angel ; but turning from the door , he placed the <unk> in its rack , and left the place .
“ He ’ s too sound asleep , Mr. Stubb ; go thou down , and wake him , and tell him .
I must see to the deck here .
Thou know ’ st what to say . ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
Next morning the <unk> sea rolled in long slow billows of mighty bulk , and striving in the Pequod ’ s <unk> track , pushed her on like <unk> ’ palms <unk> .
The strong , <unk> breeze <unk> so , that sky and air seemed vast <unk> sails ; the whole world <unk> before the wind .
<unk> in the full morning light , the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place ; where his <unk> rays moved on in <unk> .
<unk> , as of <unk> <unk> kings and queens , reigned over everything .
The sea was as a <unk> of <unk> gold , that <unk> leaps with light and heat .
Long <unk> an enchanted silence , Ahab stood apart ; and every time the <unk> ship <unk> pitched down her bowsprit , he turned to eye the bright sun ’ s rays produced ahead ; and when she <unk> settled by the stern , he turned behind , and saw the sun ’ s <unk> place , and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake .
“ Ha , ha , my ship !
thou <unk> well be taken now for the <unk> of the sun .
Ho , ho !
all ye nations before my prow , I bring the sun to ye !
<unk> on the further billows ; <unk> !
a <unk> , I drive the sea ! ” But suddenly <unk> back by some <unk> thought , he hurried towards the helm , <unk> <unk> how the ship was heading .
“ <unk> , sir , ” said the frightened steersman .
“ Thou <unk> ! ” smiting him with his clenched <unk> .
“ <unk> East at this hour in the morning , and the sun astern ? ” Upon this every soul was confounded ; for the phenomenon just then observed by Ahab had <unk> escaped every one else ; but its very blinding <unk> must have been the cause .
<unk> his head half way into the binnacle , Ahab caught one glimpse of the compasses ; his uplifted arm slowly fell ; for a moment he almost seemed to <unk> .
Standing behind him Starbuck looked , and lo !
the two compasses pointed East , and the Pequod was as infallibly going West .
But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew , the old man with a <unk> laugh exclaimed , “ I have it !
It has happened before .
Mr. Starbuck , last night ’ s thunder turned our compasses — that ’ s all .
Thou hast before now heard of such a thing , I take it . ” “ Aye ; but never before has it happened to me , sir , ” said the pale mate , <unk> .
Here , it must needs be said , that accidents like this have in more than one case occurred to ships in violent storms .
The magnetic energy , as <unk> in the mariner ’ s needle , is , as all know , <unk> one with the <unk> beheld in heaven ; hence it is not to be much marvelled at , that such things should be .
<unk> where the lightning has actually struck the vessel , so as to <unk> down some of the spars and rigging , the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal ; all its <unk> virtue being <unk> , so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife ’ s <unk> needle .
But in either case , the needle never again , of itself , <unk> the original virtue thus <unk> or lost ; and if the binnacle compasses be affected , the same fate <unk> all the others that may be in the ship ; even were the <unk> one inserted into the <unk> .
<unk> standing before the binnacle , and eyeing the <unk> compasses , the old man , with the sharp of his extended hand , now took the precise bearing of the sun , and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted , shouted out his orders for the ship ’ s course to be changed accordingly .
The yards were hard up ; and once more the Pequod thrust her <unk> bows into the opposing wind , for the supposed fair one had only been <unk> her .
Meanwhile , whatever were his own secret thoughts , Starbuck said nothing , but quietly he issued all <unk> orders ; while Stubb and Flask — who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings — likewise <unk> <unk> .
As for the men , though some of them lowly <unk> , their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate .
But as ever before , the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly <unk> ; or if <unk> , it was only with a certain <unk> shot into their congenial hearts from <unk> Ahab ’ s .
For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries .
But chancing to <unk> with his ivory heel , he saw the crushed copper <unk> of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck .
“ Thou poor , proud <unk> and sun ’ s pilot !
yesterday I wrecked thee , and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me .
So , so .
But Ahab is lord over the level <unk> yet .
Mr. Starbuck — a lance without a pole ; a top-maul , and the smallest of the <unk> ’ s needles .
Quick ! ” <unk> , perhaps , to the <unk> <unk> the thing he was now about to do , were certain <unk> motives , whose object might have been to <unk> the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his <unk> skill , in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses .
Besides , the old man well knew that to steer by <unk> needles , though <unk> practicable , was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors , without some <unk> and evil portents .
“ Men , ” said he , steadily turning upon the crew , as the mate <unk> him the things he had demanded , “ my men , the thunder turned old Ahab ’ s needles ; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own , that will point as true as any . ” <unk> glances of <unk> wonder were <unk> by the sailors , as this was said ; and with <unk> eyes they <unk> whatever magic might follow .
But Starbuck looked away .
With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance , and then <unk> to the mate the long iron rod remaining , bade him hold it upright , without its touching the deck .
Then , with the <unk> , after <unk> smiting the upper end of this iron rod , he placed the <unk> needle <unk> on the top of it , and less strongly hammered that , several times , the mate still holding the rod as before .
Then going through some small strange motions with it — whether indispensable to the <unk> of the steel , or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew , is uncertain — he called for linen <unk> ; and moving to the binnacle , slipped out the two <unk> needles there , and horizontally suspended the <unk> by its middle , over one of the <unk> .
At first , the steel went round and round , <unk> and vibrating at either end ; but at last it settled to its place , when Ahab , who had been intently watching for this result , stepped <unk> back from the binnacle , and pointing his stretched arm towards it , exclaimed , — “ Look ye , for yourselves , if Ahab be not lord of the level <unk> !
The sun is East , and that compass <unk> it ! ” One after another they peered in , for nothing but their own eyes could <unk> such ignorance as theirs , and one after another they <unk> away .
In his fiery eyes of scorn and <unk> , you then saw Ahab in all his fatal pride .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> and Line .
While now the <unk> Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage , the log and line had but very seldom been in use .
<unk> to a <unk> <unk> upon other means of <unk> the vessel ’ s place , some <unk> , and many whalemen , especially when cruising , wholly <unk> to heave the log ; though at the same time , and frequently more for form ’ s sake than anything else , regularly putting down upon the customary <unk> the course steered by the ship , as well as the presumed <unk> rate of <unk> every hour .
It had been thus with the Pequod .
The wooden reel and <unk> log attached hung , long <unk> , just beneath the <unk> of the after bulwarks .
<unk> and spray had <unk> it ; sun and wind had <unk> it ; all the elements had combined to <unk> a thing that hung so <unk> .
But <unk> of all this , his mood seized Ahab , as he happened to glance upon the reel , not many hours after the <unk> scene , and he remembered how his quadrant was no more , and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line .
The ship was sailing <unk> ; astern the billows rolled in <unk> .
“ <unk> , there !
<unk> the log ! ” Two seamen came .
The <unk> <unk> and the <unk> Manxman .
“ Take the reel , one of ye , I ’ ll heave . ” They went towards the extreme stern , on the ship ’ s lee side , where the deck , with the <unk> energy of the wind , was now almost <unk> into the creamy , <unk> sea .
The Manxman took the reel , and holding it high up , by the projecting <unk> of the <unk> , round which the <unk> of line revolved , so stood with the <unk> log hanging downwards , till Ahab advanced to him .
Ahab stood before him , and was lightly <unk> some thirty or forty turns to form a preliminary <unk> to toss overboard , when the old Manxman , who was intently eyeing both him and the line , made bold to speak .
“ Sir , I <unk> it ; this line looks far gone , long heat and wet have spoiled it . ” “ ’ <unk> hold , old gentleman .
Long heat and wet , have they spoiled thee ?
Thou seem ’ st to hold .
Or , <unk> perhaps , life holds thee ; not thou it . ” “ I hold the <unk> , sir .
But just as my captain says .
With these grey hairs of mine ’ tis not worth while <unk> , ’ specially with a superior , who ’ ll <unk> ’ er confess . ” “ What ’ s that ?
There now ’ s a patched professor in Queen Nature ’ s <unk> <unk> ; but <unk> he ’ s too <unk> .
Where <unk> thou born ? ” “ In the little rocky Isle of Man , sir . ” “ <unk> !
Thou ’ st hit the world by that . ” “ I know not , sir , but I was born there . ” “ In the Isle of Man , hey ?
Well , the other way , it ’ s good .
Here ’ s a man from Man ; a man born in once independent Man , and now <unk> of Man ; which is sucked in — by what ?
Up with the reel !
The dead , blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last .
Up with it !
So . ” The log was heaved .
The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long dragging line astern , and then , instantly , the reel began to <unk> .
In turn , <unk> raised and lowered by the rolling billows , the towing <unk> of the log caused the old <unk> to <unk> strangely .
“ Hold hard ! ” <unk> !
the <unk> line <unk> down in one long <unk> ; the <unk> log was gone .
“ I crush the quadrant , the thunder turns the needles , and now the mad sea parts the <unk> .
But Ahab can mend all .
Haul in here , <unk> ; reel up , Manxman .
And look ye , let the carpenter make another log , and mend thou the line .
See to it . ” “ There he goes now ; to him nothing ’ s happened ; but to me , the <unk> seems <unk> out of the middle of the world .
Haul in , haul in , <unk> !
These lines run whole , and whirling out : come in broken , and dragging slow .
Ha , Pip ?
come to help ; eh , Pip ? ” “ Pip ?
whom call ye Pip ?
Pip jumped from the whale-boat .
Pip ’ s missing .
Let ’ s see now if ye haven ’ t <unk> him up here , fisherman .
It drags hard ; I guess he ’ s holding on .
<unk> him , Tahiti !
<unk> him off ; we haul in no cowards here .
Ho !
there ’ s his arm just breaking water .
A <unk> !
a <unk> !
cut it off — we haul in no cowards here .
Captain Ahab !
sir , sir !
here ’ s Pip , trying to get on board again . ” “ <unk> , thou crazy <unk> , ” cried the Manxman , seizing him by the arm .
“ Away from the quarter-deck ! ” “ The greater <unk> ever <unk> the <unk> , ” muttered Ahab , advancing .
“ Hands off from that <unk> !
Where <unk> thou Pip was , boy ?
“ <unk> there , sir , astern !
<unk> !
lo ! ” “ And who art thou , boy ?
I see not my reflection in the vacant <unk> of thy eyes .
Oh God !
that man should be a thing for immortal souls to <unk> through !
Who art thou , boy ? ” “ <unk> , sir ; ship ’ <unk> ; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
Pip !
Pip !
Pip !
One hundred <unk> of clay reward for Pip ; five feet high — looks <unk> — <unk> known by that !
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
Who ’ s seen Pip the coward ? ” “ There can be no hearts above the <unk> .
Oh , ye frozen heavens !
look down here .
Ye did beget this <unk> child , and have abandoned him , ye <unk> <unk> .
Here , boy ; Ahab ’ s cabin shall be Pip ’ s home <unk> , while Ahab lives .
Thou <unk> my <unk> centre , boy ; thou art tied to me by cords woven of my <unk> .
Come , let ’ s down . ” “ What ’ s this ?
here ’ s <unk> <unk> , ” intently gazing at Ahab ’ s hand , and feeling it .
“ Ah , now , had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this , perhaps he had <unk> ’ er been lost !
This seems to me , sir , as a <unk> ; something that <unk> souls may hold by .
Oh , sir , let old Perth now come and <unk> these two hands together ; the black one with the white , for I will not let this go . ” “ Oh , boy , nor will I thee , unless I should thereby drag thee to worse horrors than are here .
Come , then , to my cabin .
<unk> !
ye <unk> in gods all goodness , and in man all ill , lo you !
see the <unk> gods <unk> of suffering man ; and man , though <unk> , and knowing not what he does , yet full of the sweet things of love and <unk> .
Come !
I feel <unk> leading thee by thy black hand , than though I grasped an <unk> ’ s ! ” “ There go two <unk> ones now , ” muttered the old Manxman .
“ One <unk> with strength , the other <unk> with <unk> .
But here ’ s the end of the <unk> line — all dripping , too .
<unk> it , eh ?
I think we had best have a new line altogether .
I ’ ll see Mr. Stubb about it . ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
<unk> now <unk> by Ahab ’ s levelled steel , and her progress solely determined by Ahab ’ s level log and line ; the Pequod held on her path towards the Equator .
<unk> so long a passage through such <unk> waters , <unk> no ships , and ere long , sideways impelled by <unk> <unk> winds , over waves <unk> mild ; all these seemed the strange calm things <unk> some <unk> and desperate scene .
At last , when the ship drew near to the <unk> , as it were , of the <unk> <unk> , and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn , was sailing by a <unk> of rocky <unk> ; the watch — then headed by Flask — was startled by a cry so <unk> wild and unearthly — like <unk> <unk> of the ghosts of all <unk> ’ s murdered <unk> — that one and all , they started from their reveries , and for the space of some moments stood , or sat , or leaned all <unk> listening , like the carved Roman slave , while that wild cry remained within hearing .
The Christian or civilized part of the crew said it was <unk> , and <unk> ; but the pagan harpooneers remained <unk> .
Yet the grey Manxman — the oldest mariner of all — declared that the wild <unk> sounds that were heard , were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea .
<unk> in his hammock , Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn , when he came to the deck ; it was then <unk> to him by Flask , not <unk> with hinted dark meanings .
He <unk> laughed , and thus explained the wonder .
Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the <unk> of great numbers of seals , and some young seals that had lost their <unk> , or some <unk> that had lost their <unk> , must have <unk> nigh the ship and kept company with her , <unk> and <unk> with their human sort of <unk> .
But this only the more affected some of them , because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals , <unk> not only from their peculiar tones when in <unk> , but also from the human look of their round heads and <unk> faces , seen <unk> uprising from the water alongside .
In the sea , under certain circumstances , seals have more than once been mistaken for men .
But the <unk> of the crew were destined to receive a most <unk> <unk> in the fate of one of their number that morning .
At <unk> this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore ; and whether it was that he was not yet half <unk> from his sleep ( for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state ) , whether it was thus with the man , there is now no telling ; but , be that as it may , he had not been long at his perch , when a cry was heard — a cry and a rushing — and looking up , they saw a falling phantom in the air ; and looking down , a little tossed <unk> of white bubbles in the blue of the sea .
The life-buoy — a long slender cask — was dropped from the stern , where it always hung <unk> to a cunning spring ; but no hand rose to seize it , and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had <unk> , so that it slowly filled , and that <unk> wood also filled at its every <unk> ; and the <unk> <unk> cask followed the sailor to the bottom , as if to yield him his pillow , though in <unk> but a hard one .
And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the White Whale , on the White Whale ’ s own peculiar ground ; that man was swallowed up in the deep .
But few , perhaps , thought of that at the time .
Indeed , in some sort , they were not <unk> at this event , at least as a <unk> ; for they regarded it , not as a <unk> of evil in the future , but as the <unk> of an evil already <unk> .
They declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before .
But again the old Manxman said nay .
The lost life-buoy was now to be <unk> ; Starbuck was directed to see to it ; but as no cask of sufficient <unk> could be found , and as in the <unk> eagerness of what seemed the approaching <unk> of the voyage , all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end , whatever that might prove to be ; therefore , they were going to leave the ship ’ s stern <unk> with a <unk> , when by certain strange signs and <unk> Queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin .
“ A life-buoy of a coffin ! ” cried Starbuck , starting .
“ Rather queer , that , I should say , ” said Stubb .
“ It will make a good enough one , ” said Flask , “ the carpenter here can <unk> it easily . ” “ <unk> it up ; there ’ s nothing else for it , ” said Starbuck , after a melancholy pause .
“ <unk> it , carpenter ; do not look at me so — the coffin , I mean .
Dost thou hear me ?
<unk> it . ” “ And shall I nail down the lid , sir ? ” moving his hand as with a hammer .
“ Aye . ” “ And shall I <unk> the seams , sir ? ” moving his hand as with a <unk> .
“ Aye . ” “ And shall I then pay over the same with pitch , sir ? ” moving his hand as with a <unk> .
“ Away !
what <unk> thee to this ?
<unk> a life-buoy of the coffin , and no more . — Mr.
Stubb , Mr. Flask , come forward with me . ” “ He goes off in a <unk> .
The whole he can endure ; at the parts he <unk> .
Now I don ’ t like this .
I make a leg for Captain Ahab , and he wears it like a gentleman ; but I make a <unk> for Queequeg , and he won ’ t put his head into it .
Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin ?
And now I ’ m ordered to make a life-buoy of it .
It ’ s like turning an old coat ; going to bring the flesh on the other side now .
I don ’ t like this <unk> sort of business — I don ’ t like it at all ; it ’ s <unk> ; it ’ s not my place .
Let <unk> ’ <unk> do <unk> ; we are their <unk> .
I like to take in hand none but clean , virgin , <unk> <unk> <unk> , something that regularly begins at the beginning , and is at the middle when midway , and comes to an end at the conclusion ; not a <unk> ’ s job , that ’ s at an end in the middle , and at the beginning at the end .
It ’ s the old woman ’ s <unk> to be giving <unk> <unk> .
Lord !
what an <unk> all old women have for <unk> .
I know an old woman of <unk> who ran away with a <unk> young <unk> once .
And that ’ s the reason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore , when I kept my <unk> in the Vineyard ; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me .
But <unk> !
there are no <unk> at sea but <unk> .
Let me see .
<unk> down the lid ; <unk> the seams ; pay over the same with pitch ; <unk> them down tight , and hang it with the <unk> over the ship ’ s stern .
Were ever such things done before with a coffin ?
Some superstitious old carpenters , now , would be tied up in the rigging , ere they would do the job .
But I ’ m made of <unk> <unk> <unk> ; I don ’ t <unk> .
<unk> with a coffin !
<unk> about with a <unk> <unk> !
But never mind .
We <unk> in woods make <unk> and <unk> , as well as coffins and <unk> .
We work by the month , or by the job , or by the profit ; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work , unless it be too confounded <unk> , and then we <unk> it if we can .
<unk> !
I ’ ll do the job , now , <unk> .
I ’ ll have me — let ’ s see — how many in the ship ’ s company , all told ?
But I ’ ve forgotten .
Any way , I ’ ll have me thirty separate , Turk ’ <unk> <unk> , each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin .
Then , if the hull go down , there ’ ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin , a sight not seen very often beneath the sun !
Come hammer , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> !
Let ’ s to it . ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The Deck .
_ The coffin laid upon two <unk> , between the <unk> and the open hatchway ; the Carpenter <unk> its seams ; the string of twisted oakum slowly <unk> from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of his <unk> . — Ahab comes slowly from the <unk> , and hears Pip following him . _ “ Back , lad ; I will be with ye again presently .
He goes !
Not this hand <unk> with my humor more <unk> than that boy . — <unk> <unk> of a church !
What ’ s here ? ” “ <unk> , sir .
Mr. Starbuck ’ s orders .
Oh , look , sir !
Beware the hatchway ! ” “ <unk> ye , man .
Thy coffin lies <unk> to the <unk> . ” “ Sir ?
The hatchway ?
oh !
So it does , sir , so it does . ” “ <unk> not thou the <unk> ?
Look , did not this stump come from thy <unk> ? ” “ I believe it did , sir ; does the <unk> stand , sir ? ” “ Well enough .
But art thou not also the <unk> ? ” “ Aye , sir ; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg ; but they ’ ve set me now to turning it into something else . ” “ Then tell me ; art thou not an <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , heathenish old <unk> , to be one day making legs , and the next day coffins to <unk> them in , and yet again <unk> out of those same coffins ?
Thou art as <unk> as the gods , and as much of a <unk> . ” “ But I do not mean anything , sir .
I do as I do . ” “ The gods again .
Hark ye , dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin ?
The <unk> , they say , <unk> <unk> when <unk> out the <unk> for <unk> ; and the <unk> in the play <unk> , spade in hand .
Dost thou never ? ” “ Sing , sir ?
Do I sing ?
Oh , I ’ m indifferent enough , sir , for that ; but the reason why the <unk> made <unk> must have been because there was none in his spade , sir .
But the <unk> <unk> is full of it .
Hark to it . ” “ Aye , and that ’ s because the lid there ’ s a <unk> ; and what in all things makes the <unk> is this — there ’ s naught beneath .
And yet , a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same , Carpenter .
Hast thou ever helped carry a <unk> , and heard the coffin <unk> against the <unk> gate , going in ?
“ Faith , sir , I ’ ve — — ” “ Faith ?
What ’ s that ? ” “ Why , faith , sir , it ’ s only a sort of <unk> — that ’ s all , sir . ” “ <unk> , um ; go on . ” “ I was about to say , sir , that — — ” “ <unk> thou a <unk> ?
Dost thou <unk> thy own shroud out of thyself ?
Look at thy bosom !
<unk> !
and get these <unk> out of sight . ” “ He goes aft .
That was sudden , now ; but squalls come sudden in hot latitudes .
I ’ ve heard that the Isle of <unk> , one of the <unk> , is cut by the Equator right in the middle .
<unk> to me some sort of Equator <unk> yon old man , too , right in his middle .
He ’ s always under the Line — fiery hot , I tell ye !
He ’ s looking this way — come , oakum ; quick .
Here we go again .
This wooden <unk> is the <unk> , and I ’ m the professor of <unk> glasses — <unk> , <unk> ! ” ( _ Ahab to himself _ . )
“ There ’ s a sight !
There ’ s a sound !
The <unk> <unk> <unk> the hollow tree !
<unk> and dumb might well be <unk> now .
See !
that thing <unk> on two <unk> , full of <unk> .
A most malicious <unk> , that fellow .
<unk> !
So man ’ s <unk> <unk> !
Oh !
how <unk> are all <unk> !
What things real are there , but <unk> thoughts ?
Here now ’ s the very dreaded symbol of grim death , by a mere <unk> , made the <unk> sign of the help and hope of most <unk> life .
A life-buoy of a coffin !
Does it go further ?
Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is , after all , but an <unk> !
I ’ ll think of that .
But no .
So far gone am I in the dark side of earth , that its other side , the <unk> bright one , seems but uncertain twilight to me .
Will ye never have done , Carpenter , with that accursed sound ?
I go below ; let me not see that thing here when I return again .
Now , then , Pip , we ’ ll talk this over ; I do <unk> most wondrous <unk> from thee !
Some unknown <unk> from the unknown worlds must empty into thee ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The Pequod Meets The Rachel .
Next day , a large ship , the Rachel , was descried , bearing directly down upon the Pequod , all her spars thickly <unk> with men .
At the time the Pequod was making good speed through the water ; but as the <unk> windward stranger shot nigh to her , the <unk> sails all fell together as blank <unk> that are burst , and all life fled from the smitten hull .
“ <unk> news ; she <unk> bad news , ” muttered the old Manxman .
But ere her commander , who , with trumpet to mouth , stood up in his boat ; ere he could <unk> hail , Ahab ’ s voice was heard .
“ Hast seen the White Whale ? ” “ Aye , yesterday .
Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift ? ” <unk> his joy , Ahab <unk> answered this <unk> question ; and would then have fain boarded the stranger , when the stranger captain himself , having stopped his vessel ’ s way , was seen descending her side .
A few keen <unk> , and his <unk> soon <unk> the Pequod ’ s <unk> , and he sprang to the deck .
<unk> he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew .
But no <unk> <unk> was <unk> .
“ Where was he ? — not killed ! — not killed ! ” cried Ahab , closely advancing .
“ How was it ? ” It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous , while three of the stranger ’ s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales , which had led them some four or five miles from the ship ; and while they were yet in swift chase to windward , the white hump and head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water , not very far to leeward ; <unk> , the fourth rigged boat — a reserved one — had been instantly lowered in chase .
After a keen sail before the wind , this fourth boat — the <unk> <unk> of all — seemed to have succeeded in <unk> — at least , as well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything about it .
In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat ; and then a swift <unk> of <unk> white water ; and after that nothing more ; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have <unk> run away with his pursuers , as often happens .
There was some apprehension , but no <unk> alarm , as yet .
The recall <unk> were placed in the rigging ; darkness came on ; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats — ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction — the ship had not only been <unk> to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight , but , for the time , to <unk> her distance from it .
But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard , she <unk> all sail — <unk> on <unk> — after the missing boat ; <unk> a fire in her <unk> for a <unk> ; and every other man aloft on the look-out .
But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen ; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her ; and not finding anything , had again dashed on ; again paused , and lowered her boats ; and though she had thus continued doing till daylight ; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen .
The story told , the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his object in <unk> the Pequod .
He desired that ship to unite with his own in the search ; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart , on parallel lines , and so sweeping a double horizon , as it were .
“ I will <unk> something now , ” whispered Stubb to Flask , “ that some one in that missing boat wore off that Captain ’ s best coat ; <unk> , his watch — he ’ s so cursed anxious to get it back .
Who ever heard of two pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height of the whaling season ?
See , Flask , only see how pale he looks — pale in the very <unk> of his eyes — look — it wasn ’ t the coat — it must have been the — ” “ My boy , my own boy is among them .
For God ’ s sake — I <unk> , I <unk> ” — here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab , who thus far had but <unk> received his <unk> .
“ For <unk> hours let me <unk> your ship — I will gladly pay for it , and <unk> pay for it — if there be no other way — for <unk> hours only — only that — you must , oh , you must , and you _ shall _ do this thing . ” “ His son ! ” cried Stubb , “ oh , it ’ s his son he ’ s lost !
I take back the coat and watch — what says Ahab ?
We must save that boy . ” “ He ’ s drowned with the rest on ’ em , last night , ” said the old <unk> sailor standing behind them ; “ I heard ; all of ye heard their spirits . ” Now , as it shortly turned out , what made this incident of the Rachel ’ s the more melancholy , was the circumstance , that not only was one of the Captain ’ s sons among the number of the missing boat ’ s crew ; but among the number of the other boat ’ s crews , at the same time , but on the other hand , separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase , there had been still another son ; as that for a time , the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the <unk> <unk> ; which was only <unk> for him by his chief mate ’ s instinctively <unk> the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such <unk> , that is , when placed between <unk> but divided boats , always to pick up the <unk> first .
But the captain , for some unknown <unk> reason , had refrained from <unk> all this , and not till forced to it by Ahab ’ s <unk> did he <unk> to his one yet missing boy ; a little lad , but twelve years old , whose father with the earnest but <unk> <unk> of a Nantucketer ’ s <unk> love , had thus early sought to <unk> him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost <unk> the <unk> of all his race .
Nor does it <unk> occur , that Nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them , for a <unk> three or four years ’ voyage in some other ship than their own ; so that their first knowledge of a whaleman ’ s career shall be <unk> by any chance <unk> of a father ’ s natural but <unk> <unk> , or <unk> apprehensiveness and concern .
Meantime , now the stranger was still <unk> his poor <unk> of Ahab ; and Ahab still stood like an anvil , receiving every shock , but without the least <unk> of his own .
“ I will not go , ” said the stranger , “ till you say _ aye _ to me .
Do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case .
For _ you _ too have a boy , Captain Ahab — though but a child , and <unk> safely at home now — a child of your old age too — Yes , yes , you <unk> ; I see it — run , run , men , now , and stand by to square in the yards . ” “ Avast , ” cried Ahab — “ touch not a <unk> ” ; then in a voice that <unk> <unk> every word — “ Captain <unk> , I will not do it .
Even now I lose time .
Good-bye , good-bye .
God bless ye , man , and may I <unk> myself , but I must go .
Mr. Starbuck , look at the binnacle watch , and in three minutes from this present instant <unk> off all strangers : then brace forward again , and let the ship sail as before . ” <unk> turning , with <unk> face , he descended into his cabin , leaving the strange captain <unk> at this unconditional and utter <unk> of his so earnest suit .
But starting from his <unk> , <unk> silently hurried to the side ; more fell than stepped into his boat , and returned to his ship .
Soon the two ships <unk> their wakes ; and long as the strange vessel was in view , she was seen to <unk> hither and thither at every dark spot , however small , on the sea .
This way and that her yards were swung round ; starboard and larboard , she continued to <unk> ; now she beat against a head sea ; and again it pushed her before it ; while all the while , her masts and yards were thickly <unk> with men , as three tall <unk> trees , when the boys are <unk> among the <unk> .
But by her still <unk> course and winding , <unk> way , you plainly saw that this ship that so <unk> with spray , still remained without comfort .
She was Rachel , <unk> for her children , because they were not .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Cabin .
( _ Ahab moving to go on deck ; Pip <unk> him by the hand to follow . _ ) “ <unk> , lad , I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now .
The hour is coming when Ahab would not <unk> thee from him , yet would not have thee by him .
There is that in thee , poor lad , which I feel too <unk> to my <unk> .
Like <unk> like ; and for this hunt , my <unk> becomes my most desired health .
Do thou <unk> below here , where they shall serve thee , as if thou <unk> the captain .
Aye , lad , thou <unk> sit here in my own screwed chair ; another <unk> to it , thou must be . ” “ No , no , no !
ye have not a whole body , sir ; do ye but use poor me for your one lost leg ; only <unk> upon me , sir ; I ask no more , so I remain a part of ye . ” “ Oh !
spite of <unk> <unk> , this makes me a <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of man ! — and a black !
and crazy ! — but <unk> <unk> <unk> to him too ; he <unk> so <unk> again . ” “ They tell me , sir , that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip , whose drowned bones now show white , for all the blackness of his living skin .
But I will never desert ye , sir , as Stubb did him .
Sir , I must go with ye . ” “ If thou <unk> thus to me much more , Ahab ’ s purpose keels up in him .
I tell thee no ; it cannot be . ” “ Oh good master , master , master !
“ <unk> so , and I will murder thee !
have a care , for Ahab too is mad .
<unk> , and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck , and still know that I am there .
And now I quit thee .
Thy hand ! — <unk> !
True art thou , lad , as the circumference to its centre .
So : God for ever bless thee ; and if it come to that , — God for ever save thee , let what will <unk> . ” ( _ Ahab goes ; Pip steps one step forward . _ ) “ Here he this instant stood ; I stand in his air , — but I ’ m alone .
Now were even poor Pip here I could endure it , but he ’ s missing .
Pip !
Pip !
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
Who ’ s seen Pip ?
He must be up here ; let ’ s try the door .
What ?
neither lock , nor bolt , nor bar ; and yet there ’ s no opening it .
It must be the spell ; he told me to stay here : Aye , and told me this screwed chair was mine .
Here , then , I ’ ll seat me , against the transom , in the ship ’ s full middle , all her keel and her three masts before me .
Here , our old sailors say , in their black <unk> great <unk> sometimes sit at table , and lord it over rows of captains and <unk> .
Ha !
what ’ s this ?
<unk> !
<unk> !
the <unk> all come crowding !
<unk> round the <unk> ; glad to see ye ; fill up , <unk> !
What an odd feeling , now , when a black boy ’ s host to white men with gold <unk> upon their <unk> ! — <unk> , have ye seen one Pip ? — a little negro lad , five feet high , <unk> look , and <unk> !
<unk> from a whale-boat once ; — seen him ?
No !
Well then , fill up again , captains , and let ’ s drink <unk> upon all cowards !
I name no names .
<unk> upon them !
<unk> one foot upon the table .
<unk> upon all cowards . — Hist !
above there , I hear ivory — Oh , master !
master !
I am indeed <unk> when you walk over me .
But here I ’ ll stay , though this stern strikes rocks ; and they <unk> through ; and <unk> come to join me . ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
And now that at the proper time and place , after so long and wide a preliminary cruise , Ahab , — all other whaling waters swept — seemed to have chased his foe into an <unk> , to slay him the more <unk> there ; now , that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his <unk> wound had been <unk> ; now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered Moby Dick ; — and now that all his successive <unk> with various ships <unk> <unk> to show the <unk> indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters , whether <unk> or <unk> against ; now it was that there lurked a something in the old man ’ s eyes , which it was hardly sufferable for <unk> souls to see .
As the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which through the <unk> , <unk> , six months ’ night <unk> its piercing , steady , central gaze ; so Ahab ’ s purpose now <unk> gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew .
It <unk> above them so , that all their <unk> , doubts , <unk> , fears , were fain to hide beneath their souls , and not <unk> forth a single spear or <unk> .
In this <unk> interval too , all humor , forced or natural , <unk> .
Stubb no more strove to raise a smile ; Starbuck no more strove to check one .
<unk> , joy and sorrow , hope and fear , seemed ground to finest dust , and <unk> , for the time , in the <unk> <unk> of Ahab ’ s iron soul .
Like <unk> , they <unk> moved about the deck , ever conscious that the old man ’ s <unk> eye was on them .
But did you deeply <unk> him in his more secret confidential hours ; when he thought no glance but one was on him ; then you would have seen that even as Ahab ’ s eyes so <unk> the crew ’ s , the inscrutable Parsee ’ s glance <unk> his ; or somehow , at least , in some wild way , at times affected it .
Such an added , gliding <unk> began to invest the thin Fedallah now ; such <unk> <unk> shook him ; that the men looked <unk> at him ; half uncertain , as it seemed , whether indeed he were a mortal substance , or else a <unk> shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being ’ s body .
And that shadow was always hovering there .
For not by night , even , had Fedallah ever certainly been known to <unk> , or go below .
He would stand still for hours : but never sat or leaned ; his <unk> but wondrous eyes did plainly say — We two <unk> never rest .
Nor , at any time , by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck , unless Ahab was before them ; either standing in his pivot-hole , or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating <unk> , — the main-mast and the <unk> ; or else they saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle , — his living foot advanced upon the deck , as if to step ; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes ; so that however motionless he stood , however the days and nights were added on , that he had not swung in his hammock ; yet hidden beneath that <unk> hat , they could never tell <unk> whether , for all this , his eyes were really closed at times ; or whether he was still intently <unk> them ; no matter , though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch , and the <unk> <unk> gathered in <unk> of <unk> upon that <unk> coat and hat .
The clothes that the night had wet , the next day ’ s <unk> dried upon him ; and so , day after day , and night after night ; he went no more beneath the planks ; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for .
He <unk> in the same open air ; that is , his two only meals , — breakfast and dinner : supper he never touched ; nor <unk> his beard ; which <unk> grew all <unk> , as <unk> <unk> of trees blown over , which still grow <unk> on at naked base , though perished in the upper verdure .
But though his whole life was now become one watch on deck ; and though the Parsee ’ s mystic watch was without <unk> as his own ; yet these two never seemed to speak — one man to the other — unless at long intervals some passing <unk> matter made it necessary .
Though such a potent spell seemed <unk> to join the twain ; <unk> , and to the <unk> crew , they seemed <unk> <unk> .
If by day they chanced to speak one word ; by night , dumb men were both , so far as concerned the slightest <unk> <unk> .
At times , for <unk> hours , without a single hail , they stood far parted in the <unk> ; Ahab in his scuttle , the Parsee by the mainmast ; but still <unk> gazing upon each other ; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his <unk> shadow , in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned substance .
And yet , somehow , did Ahab — in his own proper self , as daily , <unk> , and every instant , <unk> revealed to his <unk> , — Ahab seemed an independent lord ; the Parsee but his slave .
Still again both seemed <unk> together , and an unseen <unk> driving them ; the lean shade <unk> the solid rib .
For be this Parsee what he may , all rib and keel was solid Ahab .
At the first <unk> <unk> of the dawn , his iron voice was heard from aft , — “ Man the mast-heads ! ” — and all through the day , till after sunset and after twilight , the same voice every hour , at the striking of the helmsman ’ s bell , was heard — “ What d ’ ye see ? — sharp !
sharp ! ” But when three or four days had <unk> by , after meeting the <unk> Rachel ; and no spout had yet been seen ; the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew ’ s <unk> ; at least , of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers ; he seemed to doubt , even , whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly <unk> the sight he sought .
But if these suspicions were really his , he <unk> refrained from <unk> <unk> them , however his <unk> might seem to hint them .
“ I will have the first sight of the whale myself , ” — he said .
“ Aye !
Ahab must have the doubloon ! ” and with his own hands he rigged a nest of <unk> <unk> ; and sending a hand aloft , with a single <unk> block , to secure to the main-mast head , he received the two ends of the <unk> rope ; and <unk> one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end , in order to fasten it at the rail .
This done , with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin , he looked round upon his crew , sweeping from one to the other ; pausing his glance long upon Daggoo , Queequeg , Tashtego ; but <unk> Fedallah ; and then <unk> his firm <unk> eye upon the chief mate , said , — “ Take the rope , sir — I give it into thy hands , Starbuck . ” Then <unk> his person in the basket , he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch , Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last ; and afterwards stood near it .
And thus , with one hand clinging round the royal mast , Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles , — ahead , astern , this side , and that , — within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height .
When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging , which chances to afford no <unk> , the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot , and <unk> there by the rope ; under these circumstances , its fastened end on deck is always given in <unk> charge to some one man who has the special watch of it .
Because in such a <unk> of running rigging , whose various different <unk> aloft cannot always be infallibly <unk> by what is seen of them at the deck ; and when the <unk> of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the <unk> , it would be but a natural fatality , if , <unk> with a constant <unk> , the hoisted sailor should by some <unk> of the crew be cast adrift and fall all <unk> to the sea .
So Ahab ’ s proceedings in this matter were not unusual ; the only strange thing about them seemed to be , that Starbuck , almost the one only man who had ever <unk> to <unk> him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to <unk> — one of those too , whose <unk> on the look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat ; — it was strange , that this was the very man he should <unk> for his <unk> ; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person ’ s hands .
Now , the first time Ahab was perched aloft ; ere he had been there ten minutes ; one of those <unk> savage <unk> which so often fly <unk> close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these latitudes ; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a <unk> of <unk> swift <unk> .
Then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air ; then <unk> downwards , and went eddying again round his head .
But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon , Ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird ; nor , indeed , would any one else have marked it much , it being no uncommon circumstance ; only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight .
“ Your hat , your hat , sir ! ” suddenly cried the <unk> seaman , who being posted at the <unk> , stood directly behind Ahab , though somewhat lower than his level , and with a deep gulf of air dividing them .
But already the sable wing was before the old man ’ s eyes ; the long hooked bill at his head : with a <unk> , the black <unk> darted away with his <unk> .
An eagle flew thrice round <unk> ’ s head , removing his cap to <unk> it , and <unk> <unk> , his wife , declared that <unk> would be king of Rome .
But only by the <unk> of the cap was that omen accounted good .
Ahab ’ s hat was never <unk> ; the wild <unk> flew on and on with it ; far in advance of the prow : and at last disappeared ; while from the point of that <unk> , a minute black spot was dimly <unk> , falling from that vast height into the sea .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Pequod Meets The Delight .
The intense Pequod sailed on ; the rolling waves and days went by ; the <unk> still lightly swung ; and another ship , most <unk> <unk> the Delight , was descried .
As she drew nigh , all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams , called <unk> , which , in some <unk> , cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet ; <unk> to carry the spare , <unk> , or <unk> boats .
Upon the stranger ’ s <unk> were beheld the shattered , white ribs , and some few splintered planks , of what had once been a whale-boat ; but you now saw through this wreck , as plainly as you see through the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> skeleton of a horse .
“ Hast seen the White Whale ? ” “ Look ! ” replied the <unk> captain from his taffrail ; and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck .
“ Hast killed him ? ” “ The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that , ” answered the other , sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck , whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in <unk> together .
“ Not forged ! ” and snatching Perth ’ s levelled iron from the crotch , Ahab held it out , <unk> — “ Look ye , Nantucketer ; here in this hand I hold his death !
<unk> in blood , and <unk> by lightning are these barbs ; and I swear to <unk> them <unk> in that hot place behind the fin , where the White Whale most feels his accursed life ! ” “ Then God keep thee , old man — see ’ st thou that ” — pointing to the hammock — “ I bury but one of five stout men , who were alive only yesterday ; but were dead ere night .
Only _ that _ one I bury ; the rest were buried before they died ; you sail upon their tomb . ” Then turning to his crew — “ Are ye ready there ?
place the plank then on the rail , and lift the body ; so , then — Oh !
God ” — advancing towards the hammock with uplifted hands — “ may the resurrection and the life — — ” “ <unk> forward !
Up helm ! ” cried Ahab like lightning to his men .
But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the <unk> that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea ; not so quick , indeed , but that some of the flying bubbles might have <unk> her hull with their <unk> <unk> .
As Ahab now glided from the <unk> Delight , the strange life-buoy hanging at the Pequod ’ s stern came into conspicuous relief .
“ Ha !
yonder !
look yonder , men ! ” cried a <unk> voice in her wake .
“ In vain , oh , ye strangers , ye fly our sad <unk> ; ye but turn us your taffrail to show us your coffin ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
It was a clear <unk> day .
The <unk> of air and sea were hardly <unk> in that <unk> azure ; only , the <unk> air was <unk> pure and soft , with a woman ’ s look , and the <unk> and <unk> sea heaved with long , strong , lingering swells , as <unk> ’ s chest in his sleep .
<unk> , and thither , on high , glided the snow-white wings of small , <unk> birds ; these were the gentle thoughts of the <unk> air ; but to and fro in the deeps , far down in the bottomless blue , rushed mighty leviathans , sword-fish , and sharks ; and these were the strong , troubled , murderous <unk> of the <unk> sea .
But though thus contrasting within , the contrast was only in shades and shadows without ; those two seemed one ; it was only the <unk> , as it were , that distinguished them .
Aloft , like a royal <unk> and king , the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea ; even as bride to <unk> .
And at the <unk> line of the horizon , a soft and <unk> motion — most seen here at the equator — <unk> the fond , <unk> trust , the loving <unk> , with which the poor bride gave her bosom away .
<unk> up and twisted ; <unk> and knotted with wrinkles ; <unk> firm and <unk> ; his eyes glowing like coals , that still <unk> in the ashes of ruin ; <unk> Ahab stood forth in the <unk> of the <unk> ; lifting his splintered <unk> of a brow to the fair girl ’ s forehead of heaven .
Oh , immortal infancy , and <unk> of the azure !
<unk> <unk> creatures that <unk> all round us !
<unk> <unk> of air and sky !
how <unk> were ye of old Ahab ’ s <unk> woe !
But so have I seen little <unk> and Martha , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> around their old <unk> ; sporting with the circle of <unk> <unk> which grew on the <unk> of that <unk> <unk> of his brain .
<unk> crossing the deck from the scuttle , Ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze , the more and the more that he strove to <unk> the <unk> .
But the lovely <unk> in that enchanted air did at last seem to <unk> , for a moment , the <unk> thing in his soul .
That glad , happy air , that <unk> sky , did at last stroke and <unk> him ; the <unk> world , so long cruel — <unk> — now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck , and did seem to <unk> <unk> over him , as if over one , that however wilful and <unk> , she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless .
From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea ; nor did all the Pacific contain such <unk> as that one <unk> drop .
Starbuck saw the old man ; saw him , how he heavily leaned over the side ; and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless <unk> that stole out of the centre of the serenity around .
<unk> not to touch him , or be noticed by him , he yet drew near to him , and stood there .
Ahab turned .
“ Starbuck ! ” “ Sir . ” “ Oh , Starbuck !
it is a mild , mild wind , and a mild looking sky .
On such a day — very much such a <unk> as this — I struck my first whale — a <unk> of eighteen !
<unk> — forty — forty years ago ! — ago !
<unk> years of continual whaling !
forty years of <unk> , and peril , and <unk> !
forty years on the <unk> sea !
for forty years has Ahab <unk> the peaceful land , for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep !
Aye and yes , Starbuck , out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore .
When I think of this life I have led ; the <unk> of <unk> it has been ; the <unk> , <unk> of a Captain ’ s <unk> , which <unk> but small entrance to any <unk> from the green country without — oh , <unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> <unk> of solitary command ! — when I think of all this ; only <unk> , not so <unk> known to me before — and how for forty years I have <unk> upon dry salted fare — fit <unk> of the dry <unk> of my soil ! — when the <unk> landsman has had fresh <unk> to his daily hand , and broken the world ’ s fresh bread to my mouldy <unk> — away , whole oceans away , from that young <unk> I wedded past fifty , and sailed for Cape Horn the next day , leaving but one <unk> in my <unk> pillow — wife ?
wife ? — rather a widow with her <unk> alive !
Aye , I <unk> that poor girl when I <unk> her , Starbuck ; and then , the madness , the <unk> , the boiling blood and the smoking brow , with which , for a thousand <unk> old Ahab has furiously , <unk> chased his prey — more a <unk> than a man ! — aye , aye !
what a forty years ’ fool — fool — old fool , has old Ahab been !
Why this <unk> of the chase ?
why weary , and <unk> the arm at the oar , and the iron , and the lance ?
how the <unk> or better is Ahab now ?
<unk> .
Oh , Starbuck !
is it not hard , that with this weary <unk> I bear , one poor leg should have been snatched from under me ?
Here , <unk> this old hair aside ; it blinds me , that I seem to <unk> .
<unk> so grey did never grow but from out some ashes !
But do I look very old , so very , very old , Starbuck ?
I feel deadly faint , bowed , and <unk> , as though I were Adam , <unk> beneath the piled centuries since Paradise .
God !
God !
God ! — crack my heart ! — stave my brain ! — <unk> !
<unk> !
bitter , biting <unk> of grey hairs , have I lived enough joy to wear ye ; and seem and feel thus <unk> old ?
<unk> !
stand close to me , Starbuck ; let me look into a human eye ; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky ; better than to gaze upon God .
By the green land ; by the bright <unk> !
this is the magic glass , man ; I see my wife and my child in thine eye .
No , no ; stay on board , on board ! — lower not when I do ; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick .
That <unk> shall not be thine .
No , no !
not with the far away home I see in that eye ! ” “ Oh , my Captain !
my Captain !
noble soul !
grand old heart , after all !
why should any one give chase to that hated fish !
Away with me !
let us fly these deadly waters !
let us home !
<unk> and child , too , are Starbuck ’ s — wife and child of his <unk> , <unk> , <unk> youth ; even as thine , sir , are the wife and child of thy loving , <unk> , <unk> old age !
Away !
let us away ! — this instant let me <unk> the course !
How cheerily , how <unk> , O my Captain , would we bowl on our way to see old Nantucket again !
I think , sir , they have some such mild blue days , even as this , in Nantucket . ” “ They have , they have .
I have seen them — some summer days in the morning .
About this time — yes , it is his noon nap now — the boy <unk> wakes ; sits up in bed ; and his mother tells him of me , of cannibal old me ; how I am abroad upon the deep , but will yet come back to dance him again . ” “ ’ Tis my Mary , my Mary herself !
She <unk> that my boy , every morning , should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father ’ s sail !
Yes , yes !
no more !
it is done !
we head for Nantucket !
Come , my Captain , study out the course , and let us away !
See , see !
the boy ’ s face from the window !
the boy ’ s hand on the hill ! ” But Ahab ’ s glance was <unk> ; like a <unk> <unk> tree he shook , and cast his last , <unk> <unk> to the soil .
“ What is it , what nameless , inscrutable , unearthly thing is it ; what <unk> , hidden lord and master , and cruel , remorseless <unk> <unk> me ; that against all natural <unk> and <unk> , I so keep pushing , and crowding , and <unk> myself on all the time ; recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper , natural heart , I <unk> not so much as dare ?
Is Ahab , Ahab ?
Is it I , God , or who , that <unk> this arm ?
But if the great sun move not of himself ; but is as an <unk> in heaven ; nor one single <unk> can <unk> , but by some invisible power ; how then can this one small heart beat ; this one small brain think thoughts ; unless God does that beating , does that thinking , does that living , and not I.
By heaven , man , we are turned round and round in this world , like yonder windlass , and Fate is the <unk> .
And all the time , lo !
that <unk> sky , and this <unk> sea !
Look !
see yon <unk> !
who put it into him to chase and <unk> that <unk> ?
Where do murderers go , man !
Who ’ s to doom , when the judge himself is dragged to the bar ?
But it is a mild , mild wind , and a mild looking sky ; and the air smells now , as if it blew from a <unk> meadow ; they have been making <unk> somewhere under the <unk> of the Andes , Starbuck , and the mowers are sleeping among the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ?
Aye , toil we how we may , we all sleep at last on the field .
<unk> ?
Aye , and rust amid <unk> ; as last year ’ s <unk> flung down , and left in the <unk> <unk> — Starbuck ! ” But <unk> to a corpse ’ s hue with despair , the <unk> had <unk> away .
Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side ; but started at two <unk> , fixed eyes in the water there .
Fedallah was <unk> leaning over the same rail .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Chase — First Day .
That night , in the <unk> , when the old man — as his wont at intervals — stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned , and went to his pivot-hole , he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely , <unk> up the sea air as a sagacious ship ’ s dog will , in drawing nigh to some <unk> isle .
He declared that a whale must be near .
Soon that peculiar odor , sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale , was <unk> to all the watch ; nor was any mariner surprised when , after <unk> the compass , and then the <unk> , and then <unk> the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible , Ahab rapidly ordered the ship ’ s course to be slightly <unk> , and the sail to be <unk> .
The <unk> policy <unk> these <unk> was sufficiently <unk> at <unk> , by the sight of a long <unk> on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead , smooth as oil , and resembling in the <unk> watery wrinkles <unk> it , the polished <unk> marks of some swift <unk> , at the mouth of a deep , rapid stream .
“ Man the mast-heads !
<unk> all hands ! ” <unk> with the butts of three <unk> handspikes on the forecastle deck , Daggoo <unk> the sleepers with such judgment <unk> that they seemed to <unk> from the scuttle , so <unk> did they appear with their clothes in their hands .
“ What d ’ ye see ? ” cried Ahab , <unk> his face to the sky .
“ Nothing , nothing sir ! ” was the sound hailing down in reply .
“ <unk> ’ gallant sails ! — <unk> !
<unk> and aloft , and on both sides ! ” All sail being set , he now cast loose the <unk> , reserved for swaying him to the main <unk> head ; and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither , when , while but two thirds of the way aloft , and while peering ahead through the horizontal <unk> between the <unk> and <unk> , he raised a <unk> cry in the air .
“ There she blows ! — there she blows !
A hump like a <unk> !
It is Moby Dick ! ” <unk> by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three look-outs , the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing .
Ahab had now gained his final perch , some feet above the other look-outs , Tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the <unk> , so that the Indian ’ s head was almost on a level with Ahab ’ s heel .
From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead , at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump , and regularly <unk> his silent spout into the air .
To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the <unk> Atlantic and Indian <unk> .
“ And did none of ye see it before ? ” cried Ahab , hailing the perched men all around him .
“ I saw him almost that same instant , sir , that Captain Ahab did , and I cried out , ” said Tashtego .
“ Not the same instant ; not the same — no , the doubloon is mine , Fate reserved the doubloon for me .
_ I _ only ; none of ye could have raised the White Whale first .
There she blows ! — there she blows ! — there she blows !
There again ! — there again ! ” he cried , in <unk> , lingering , <unk> tones , <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of the whale ’ s visible jets .
“ He ’ s going to sound !
In <unk> !
Down <unk> !
Stand by three boats .
Mr. Starbuck , remember , stay on board , and keep the ship .
<unk> there !
<unk> , <unk> a point !
So ; steady , man , steady !
There go flukes !
No , no ; only black water !
All ready the boats there ?
Stand by , stand by !
Lower me , Mr. Starbuck ; lower , lower , — quick , <unk> ! ” and he slid through the air to the deck .
“ He is heading straight to leeward , sir , ” cried Stubb , “ right away from us ; cannot have seen the ship yet . ” “ Be dumb , man !
Stand by the braces !
<unk> down the helm ! — brace up !
<unk> her ! — shiver her ! — So ; well that !
<unk> , boats ! ” Soon all the boats but Starbuck ’ s were dropped ; all the <unk> set — all the <unk> <unk> ; with <unk> swiftness , shooting to leeward ; and Ahab heading the onset .
A pale , <unk> <unk> up Fedallah ’ s sunken eyes ; a hideous motion <unk> his mouth .
Like noiseless <unk> <unk> , their light <unk> <unk> through the sea ; but only slowly they neared the foe .
As they neared him , the ocean grew still more smooth ; seemed drawing a <unk> over its waves ; seemed a <unk> , so <unk> it spread .
At length the <unk> hunter came so nigh his seemingly <unk> prey , that his entire <unk> hump was distinctly visible , sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing , and continually set in a revolving ring of finest , <unk> , <unk> foam .
He saw the vast , involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond .
<unk> it , far out on the soft <unk> waters , went the glistening white shadow from his broad , milky forehead , a <unk> <unk> <unk> accompanying the shade ; and behind , the blue waters <unk> flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake ; and on either hand bright bubbles <unk> and <unk> by his side .
But these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly <unk> the sea , <unk> with their <unk> flight ; and like to some <unk> rising from the painted hull of an <unk> , the tall but shattered pole of a <unk> lance <unk> from the white whale ’ s back ; and at intervals one of the <unk> of <unk> fowls hovering , and to and fro <unk> like a <unk> over the fish , silently perched and rocked on this pole , the long tail <unk> <unk> like <unk> .
A gentle <unk> — a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness , invested the gliding whale .
Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with <unk> <unk> clinging to his <unk> horns ; his lovely , <unk> eyes sideways intent upon the <unk> ; with smooth <unk> <unk> , <unk> straight for the <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; not Jove , not that great majesty <unk> !
did <unk> the <unk> White Whale as he so <unk> swam .
On each soft side — <unk> with the parted swell , that but once leaving him , then flowed so wide away — on each bright side , the whale shed off <unk> .
No wonder there had been some among the hunters who <unk> <unk> and <unk> by all this serenity , had <unk> to <unk> it ; but had <unk> found that quietude but the <unk> of <unk> .
Yet calm , <unk> calm , oh , whale !
thou <unk> on , to all who for the first time eye thee , no matter how many in that same way thou may ’ st have <unk> and destroyed before .
And thus , through the serene <unk> of the tropical sea , among waves whose <unk> were suspended by exceeding <unk> , Moby Dick moved on , still <unk> from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk , entirely <unk> the wrenched <unk> of his jaw .
But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water ; for an instant his whole <unk> body formed a high <unk> , like Virginia ’ s Natural <unk> , and <unk> waving his <unk> flukes in the air , the grand god revealed himself , sounded , and went out of sight .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> on the wing , the white <unk> <unk> lingered over the agitated pool that he left .
With oars <unk> , and <unk> down , the sheets of their sails adrift , the three boats now <unk> floated , awaiting Moby Dick ’ s <unk> .
“ An hour , ” said Ahab , standing rooted in his boat ’ s stern ; and he gazed beyond the whale ’ s place , towards the dim blue spaces and wide <unk> <unk> to leeward .
It was only an instant ; for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle .
The breeze now <unk> ; the sea began to swell .
“ The birds ! — the birds ! ” cried Tashtego .
In long Indian file , as when <unk> take wing , the white birds were now all flying towards Ahab ’ s boat ; and when within a few yards began <unk> over the water there , wheeling round and round , with <unk> , <unk> cries .
Their vision was <unk> than man ’ s ; Ahab could discover no sign in the sea .
But suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths , he <unk> saw a white living spot no <unk> than a white <unk> , with wonderful <unk> uprising , and <unk> as it rose , till it turned , and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white , glistening teeth , floating up from the <unk> bottom .
It was Moby Dick ’ s open mouth and <unk> jaw ; his vast , <unk> bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea .
The glittering mouth <unk> beneath the boat like an <unk> marble tomb ; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar , Ahab <unk> the craft aside from this tremendous apparition .
Then , calling upon Fedallah to change places with him , went forward to the bows , and seizing Perth ’ s harpoon , commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern .
Now , by reason of this <unk> spinning round the boat upon its axis , its bow , by <unk> , was made to face the whale ’ s head while yet under water .
But as if <unk> this <unk> , Moby Dick , with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him , <unk> <unk> himself , as it were , in an instant , shooting his <unk> head lengthwise beneath the boat .
Through and through ; through every plank and each rib , it <unk> for an instant , the whale obliquely lying on his back , in the manner of a biting shark , slowly and <unk> taking its bows full within his mouth , so that the long , narrow , <unk> lower jaw curled high up into the open air , and one of the teeth caught in a <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab ’ s head , and reached higher than that .
In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel <unk> her <unk> .
With <unk> eyes Fedallah gazed , and crossed his arms ; but the <unk> crew were <unk> over each other ’ s heads to gain the uttermost stern .
And now , while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out , as the whale <unk> with the <unk> craft in this devilish way ; and from his body being submerged beneath the boat , he could not be darted at from the bows , for the bows were almost inside of him , as it were ; and while the other boats involuntarily paused , as before a quick <unk> impossible to withstand , then it was that monomaniac Ahab , furious with this <unk> vicinity of his foe , which placed him all alive and <unk> in the very jaws he hated ; <unk> with all this , he seized the long bone with his naked hands , and wildly strove to <unk> it from its <unk> .
As now he thus vainly strove , the jaw slipped from him ; the <unk> gunwales bent in , <unk> , and snapped , as both jaws , like an enormous <unk> , sliding further aft , bit the craft completely in twain , and locked themselves fast again in the sea , midway between the two floating <unk> .
These floated aside , the broken ends drooping , the crew at the <unk> clinging to the gunwales , and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across .
At that <unk> moment , ere the boat was yet snapped , Ahab , the first to perceive the whale ’ s intent , by the <unk> <unk> of his head , a movement that <unk> his hold for the time ; at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the <unk> .
But only slipping further into the whale ’ s mouth , and <unk> over sideways as it slipped , the boat had <unk> off his hold on the jaw ; spilled him out of it , as he leaned to the push ; and so he fell <unk> upon the sea .
<unk> withdrawing from his prey , Moby Dick now lay at a little distance , <unk> thrusting his <unk> white head up and down in the billows ; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole <unk> body ; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose — some twenty or more feet out of the water — the now rising swells , with all their <unk> waves , <unk> broke against it ; <unk> tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air .
* So , in a gale , the but half <unk> <unk> billows only <unk> from the base of the <unk> , <unk> to <unk> its summit with their scud .
* This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale .
It <unk> its <unk> ( pitchpoling ) from its being likened to that preliminary <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , in the <unk> called pitchpoling , previously described .
By this motion the whale must best and most <unk> view whatever objects may be <unk> him .
But soon resuming his horizontal attitude , Moby Dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew ; sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake , as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault .
The sight of the splintered boat seemed to <unk> him , as the blood of <unk> and <unk> cast before <unk> ’ s elephants in the book of <unk> .
Meanwhile Ahab half <unk> in the foam of the whale ’ s <unk> tail , and too much of a <unk> to swim , — though he could still keep afloat , even in the heart of such a <unk> as that ; <unk> Ahab ’ s head was seen , like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst .
From the boat ’ s <unk> stern , Fedallah <unk> and mildly eyed him ; the clinging crew , at the other <unk> end , could not <unk> him ; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves .
For so <unk> appalling was the White Whale ’ s aspect , and so <unk> swift the <unk> circles he made , that he seemed horizontally <unk> upon them .
And though the other boats , unharmed , still hovered hard by ; still they dared not pull into the <unk> to strike , lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the <unk> <unk> , Ahab and all ; nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape .
With straining eyes , then , they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone , whose centre had now become the old man ’ s head .
Meantime , from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship ’ s mast heads ; and <unk> her yards , she had borne down upon the scene ; and was now so nigh , that Ahab in the water hailed her ! — “ Sail on the ” — but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick , and <unk> him for the time .
But struggling out of it again , and chancing to rise on a <unk> <unk> , he shouted , — “ Sail on the whale ! — <unk> him off ! ” The Pequod ’ s <unk> were pointed ; and breaking up the <unk> circle , she <unk> parted the white whale from his <unk> .
As he <unk> swam off , the boats flew to the rescue .
<unk> into Stubb ’ s boat with <unk> , <unk> eyes , the white brine <unk> in his wrinkles ; the long <unk> of Ahab ’ s bodily strength did crack , and <unk> he <unk> to his body ’ s doom : for a time , lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb ’ s boat , like one <unk> under foot of herds of elephants .
Far inland , nameless <unk> came from him , as <unk> sounds from out <unk> .
But this intensity of his physical <unk> did but so much the more <unk> it .
In an instant ’ s compass , great hearts sometimes <unk> to one deep <unk> , the sum <unk> of those <unk> pains <unk> <unk> through <unk> men ’ s whole lives .
And so , such hearts , though <unk> in each one suffering ; still , if the gods <unk> it , in their <unk> <unk> a whole age of woe , wholly made up of instantaneous <unk> ; for even in their <unk> <unk> , those noble <unk> contain the entire <unk> of inferior souls .
“ The harpoon , ” said Ahab , half way rising , and <unk> leaning on one <unk> arm — “ is it safe ? ” “ Aye , sir , for it was not darted ; this is it , ” said Stubb , showing it .
“ Lay it before me ; — any missing men ? ” “ One , two , three , four , five ; — there were five oars , sir , and here are five men . ” “ That ’ s good . — <unk> me , man ; I wish to stand .
So , so , I see him !
there !
there !
going to leeward still ; what a leaping spout ! — Hands off from me !
The eternal <unk> runs up in Ahab ’ s bones again !
<unk> the sail ; out oars ; the helm ! ” It is often the case that when a boat is stove , its crew , being picked up by another boat , help to work that second boat ; and the chase is thus continued with what is called <unk> oars .
It was thus now .
But the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale , for he seemed to have <unk> his every fin ; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed , that if now , under these circumstances , pushed on , the chase would prove an <unk> prolonged , if not a hopeless one ; nor could any crew endure for so long a period , such an <unk> , intense straining at the oar ; a thing <unk> tolerable only in some one brief <unk> .
The ship itself , then , as it sometimes happens , offered the most promising <unk> means of <unk> the chase .
<unk> , the boats now made for her , and were soon swayed up to their <unk> — the two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her — and then hoisting everything to her side , and <unk> her canvas high up , and sideways <unk> it with <unk> , like the <unk> wings of an albatross ; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of <unk> .
At the well known , <unk> intervals , the whale ’ s glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mast-heads ; and when he would be reported as just gone down , Ahab would take the time , and then pacing the deck , <unk> in hand , so soon as the last second of the <unk> hour <unk> , his voice was heard . — “ <unk> is the doubloon now ?
D ’ ye see him ? ” and if the reply was , No , sir !
straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch .
In this way the day wore on ; Ahab , now aloft and motionless ; anon , <unk> pacing the planks .
As he was thus walking , <unk> no sound , except to hail the men aloft , or to bid them hoist a sail still higher , or to spread one to a still greater breadth — thus to and fro pacing , beneath his slouched hat , at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat , which had been dropped upon the quarter-deck , and lay there <unk> ; broken bow to shattered stern .
At last he paused before it ; and as in an already <unk> sky fresh <unk> of clouds will sometimes sail across , so over the old man ’ s face there now stole some such added gloom as this .
Stubb saw him pause ; and perhaps <unk> , not vainly , though , to <unk> his own <unk> fortitude , and thus keep up a valiant place in his Captain ’ s mind , he advanced , and eyeing the wreck exclaimed — “ The <unk> the <unk> <unk> ; it <unk> his mouth too <unk> , sir ; ha !
ha ! ” “ What <unk> thing is this that <unk> before a wreck ?
Man , man !
did I not know thee brave as fearless fire ( and as mechanical ) I could swear thou <unk> a <unk> .
<unk> nor laugh should be heard before a wreck . ” “ Aye , sir , ” said Starbuck drawing near , “ ’ tis a solemn sight ; an omen , and an ill one . ” “ <unk> ?
omen ? — the <unk> !
If the gods think to speak <unk> to man , they will <unk> speak <unk> ; not shake their heads , and give an old wives ’ <unk> hint . — <unk> !
Ye two are the opposite poles of one thing ; Starbuck is Stubb <unk> , and Stubb is Starbuck ; and ye two are all mankind ; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the <unk> earth , nor gods nor men his <unk> !
<unk> , cold — I shiver ! — How now ?
Aloft there !
D ’ ye see him ?
Sing out for every spout , though he spout ten times a second ! ” The day was nearly done ; only the <unk> of his golden <unk> was <unk> .
Soon , it was almost dark , but the look-out men still remained <unk> .
“ Can ’ t see the spout now , sir ; — too dark ” — cried a voice from the air .
“ How heading when last seen ? ” “ As before , sir , — straight to leeward . ” “ Good !
he will travel <unk> now ’ tis night .
Down <unk> and top-gallant <unk> , Mr. Starbuck .
We must not run over him before morning ; he ’ s making a passage now , and may <unk> a while .
<unk> there !
keep her full before the wind ! — Aloft !
come down ! — Mr.
Stubb , send a fresh hand to the <unk> head , and see it manned till morning . ” — Then advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast — “ Men , this gold is mine , for I <unk> it ; but I shall let it <unk> here till the White Whale is dead ; and then , <unk> of ye first raises him , upon the day he shall be killed , this gold is that man ’ s ; and if on that day I shall again raise him , then , ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye !
Away now ! — the deck is thine , sir ! ” And so saying , he placed himself half way within the scuttle , and <unk> his hat , stood there till dawn , except when at intervals <unk> himself to see how the night wore on .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Chase — Second Day .
At <unk> , the three mast-heads were <unk> manned <unk> .
“ D ’ ye see him ? ” cried Ahab after <unk> a little space for the light to spread .
“ See nothing , sir . ” “ Turn up all hands and make sail !
he <unk> <unk> than I thought for ; — the top-gallant sails ! — aye , they should have been kept on her all night .
But no matter — ’ tis but resting for the rush . ” Here be it said , that this <unk> pursuit of one particular whale , continued through day into night , and through night into day , is a thing by no means <unk> in the South sea fishery .
For such is the wonderful skill , <unk> of experience , and <unk> confidence <unk> by some great natural <unk> among the Nantucket <unk> ; that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried , they will , under certain given circumstances , pretty <unk> <unk> both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time , while out of sight , as well as his probable rate of <unk> during that period .
And , in these cases , somewhat as a pilot , when about losing sight of a coast , whose general <unk> he well knows , and which he desires shortly to return to again , but at some further point ; like as this pilot stands by his compass , and takes the precise bearing of the <unk> at present visible , in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote , unseen <unk> , eventually to be visited : so does the fisherman , at his compass , with the whale ; for after being chased , and diligently marked , through several hours of daylight , then , when night <unk> the fish , the creature ’ s future wake through the darkness is almost as <unk> to the sagacious mind of the hunter , as the pilot ’ s coast is to him .
So that to this hunter ’ s wondrous skill , the <unk> <unk> of a thing <unk> in water , a wake , is to all desired <unk> well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land .
And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern <unk> is so familiarly known in its every pace , that , with watches in their hands , men time his rate as doctors that of a baby ’ s <unk> ; and lightly say of it , the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot , at such or such an hour ; even so , almost , there are occasions when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep , according to the observed humor of his speed ; and say to themselves , so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles , will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude .
But to render this <unk> at all successful in the end , the wind and the sea must be the whaleman ’ s <unk> ; for of what present <unk> to the <unk> or <unk> mariner is the skill that <unk> him he is exactly <unk> leagues and a quarter from his port ?
<unk> from these statements , are many <unk> <unk> matters touching the chase of whales .
The ship tore on ; leaving such a <unk> in the sea as when a <unk> , <unk> , becomes a <unk> and turns up the level field .
“ By salt and hemp ! ” cried Stubb , “ but this swift motion of the deck <unk> up one ’ s legs and <unk> at the heart .
This ship and I are two brave fellows ! — Ha , ha !
Some one take me up , and <unk> me , <unk> , on the sea , — for by <unk> !
my spine ’ s a keel .
Ha , ha !
we go the <unk> that leaves no dust behind ! ” “ There she blows — she blows ! — she blows ! — right ahead ! ” was now the mast-head cry .
“ Aye , aye ! ” cried Stubb , “ I knew it — ye can ’ t escape — blow on and split your spout , O whale !
the mad fiend himself is after ye !
blow your <unk> — <unk> your lungs ! — Ahab will dam off your blood , as a <unk> <unk> his <unk> upon the stream ! ” And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew .
The <unk> of the chase had by this time worked them <unk> up , like old wine worked anew .
<unk> pale fears and <unk> some of them might have felt before ; these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of Ahab , but they were broken up , and on all sides <unk> , as timid prairie <unk> that <unk> before the <unk> <unk> .
The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls ; and by the <unk> perils of the previous day ; the rack of the past night ’ s <unk> ; the fixed , <unk> , blind , reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark ; by all these things , their hearts were <unk> along .
The wind that made great bellies of their sails , and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible ; this seemed the symbol of that unseen <unk> which so <unk> them to the race .
They were one man , not thirty .
For as the one ship that held them all ; though it was put together of all contrasting things — oak , and <unk> , and pine wood ; iron , and pitch , and hemp — yet all these ran into each other in the one <unk> hull , which shot on its way , both <unk> and directed by the long central keel ; even so , all the <unk> of the crew , this man ’ s <unk> , that man ’ s fear ; <unk> and <unk> , all varieties were welded into <unk> , and were all directed to that fatal <unk> which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to .
The rigging lived .
The mast-heads , like the <unk> of tall palms , were <unk> tufted with arms and legs .
<unk> to a spar with one hand , some reached forth the other with impatient <unk> ; others , <unk> their eyes from the vivid sunlight , sat far out on the rocking yards ; all the spars in full bearing of mortals , ready and ripe for their fate .
Ah !
how they still strove through that infinite <unk> to seek out the thing that might destroy them !
“ Why sing ye not out for him , if ye see him ? ” cried Ahab , when , after the <unk> of some minutes since the first cry , no more had been heard .
“ <unk> me up , men ; ye have been <unk> ; not Moby Dick <unk> one odd jet that way , and then <unk> . ” It was even so ; in their headlong eagerness , the men had mistaken some other thing for the <unk> , as the event itself soon proved ; for hardly had Ahab reached his perch ; hardly was the rope <unk> to its pin on deck , when he struck the <unk> to an <unk> , that made the air <unk> as with the combined <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of thirty <unk> lungs was heard , as — much nearer to the ship than the place of the <unk> jet , less than a mile ahead — Moby Dick bodily burst into view !
For not by any calm and indolent spoutings ; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head , did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity ; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of <unk> .
<unk> with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths , the Sperm Whale thus <unk> his entire bulk into the pure element of air , and <unk> up a mountain of <unk> foam , shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more .
In those moments , the torn , enraged waves he shakes off , seem his <unk> ; in some cases , this <unk> is his act of <unk> .
“ There she breaches !
there she breaches ! ” was the cry , as in his <unk> <unk> the White Whale tossed himself <unk> to Heaven .
So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea , and relieved against the still <unk> margin of the sky , the spray that he raised , for the moment , <unk> <unk> and <unk> like a <unk> ; and stood there gradually <unk> and <unk> away from its first sparkling intensity , to the dim <unk> of an advancing shower in a <unk> .
“ Aye , <unk> your last to the sun , Moby Dick ! ” cried Ahab , “ thy hour and thy harpoon are at hand ! — Down !
down all of ye , but one man at the fore .
The boats ! — stand by ! ” <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the shrouds , the men , like shooting stars , slid to the deck , by the isolated <unk> and <unk> ; while Ahab , less <unk> , but still rapidly was dropped from his perch .
“ Lower away , ” he cried , so soon as he had reached his boat — a spare one , rigged the afternoon previous .
“ Mr.
Starbuck , the ship is thine — keep away from the boats , but keep near them .
Lower , all ! ” As if to strike a quick terror into them , by this time being the first <unk> himself , Moby Dick had turned , and was now coming for the three crews .
Ahab ’ s boat was central ; and cheering his men , he told them he would take the whale <unk> , — that is , pull straight up to his forehead , — a not uncommon thing ; for when within a certain limit , such a course <unk> the coming onset from the whale ’ s sidelong vision .
But ere that close limit was gained , and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship ’ s three masts to his eye ; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed , almost in an instant as it were , rushing among the boats with open jaws , and a lashing tail , offered appalling battle on every side ; and <unk> of the irons darted at him from every boat , seemed only intent on <unk> each separate plank of which those boats were made .
But <unk> <unk> , <unk> wheeling like <unk> <unk> in the field ; the boats for a while <unk> him ; though , at times , but by a plank ’ s breadth ; while all the time , Ahab ’ s unearthly <unk> tore every other cry but his to shreds .
But at last in his <unk> <unk> , the White Whale so crossed and <unk> , and in a thousand ways entangled the <unk> of the three lines now fast to him , that they <unk> , and , of themselves , <unk> the <unk> boats towards the planted irons in him ; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little , as if to <unk> for a more tremendous charge .
<unk> that opportunity , Ahab first paid out more line : and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again — <unk> that way to <unk> it of some <unk> — when lo ! — a sight more savage than the <unk> teeth of sharks !
<unk> and twisted — <unk> in the <unk> of the line , loose harpoons and lances , with all their <unk> barbs and points , came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab ’ s boat .
Only one thing could be done .
<unk> the <unk> , he <unk> reached within — through — and then , without — the rays of steel ; dragged in the line beyond , passed it , <unk> , to the bowsman , and then , twice <unk> the rope near the chocks — dropped the <unk> <unk> of steel into the sea ; and was all fast again .
That instant , the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining <unk> of the other lines ; by so doing , <unk> dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes ; dashed them together like two rolling <unk> on a <unk> beach , and then , diving down into the sea , disappeared in a boiling <unk> , in which , for a space , the <unk> cedar chips of the <unk> <unk> round and round , like the <unk> <unk> in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch .
While the two crews were yet <unk> in the waters , reaching out after the revolving <unk> , oars , and other floating furniture , while <unk> little Flask <unk> up and down like an empty vial , <unk> his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks ; and Stubb was <unk> singing out for some one to <unk> him up ; and while the old man ’ s line — now <unk> — <unk> of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could ; — in that wild <unk> of a thousand <unk> perils , — Ahab ’ s yet <unk> boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven by invisible <unk> , — as , <unk> , shooting perpendicularly from the sea , the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom , and sent it , turning over and over , into the air ; till it fell again — gunwale downwards — and Ahab and his men <unk> out from under it , like seals from a <unk> cave .
The first uprising <unk> of the whale — <unk> its direction as he struck the surface — involuntarily launched him along it , to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made ; and with his back to it , he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side ; and whenever a <unk> oar , bit of plank , the least chip or <unk> of the boats touched his skin , his tail swiftly drew back , and came sideways smiting the sea .
But soon , as if satisfied that his work for that time was done , he pushed his <unk> forehead through the ocean , and <unk> after him the <unk> lines , continued his leeward way at a traveller ’ s <unk> pace .
As before , the <unk> ship having descried the whole fight , again came bearing down to the rescue , and dropping a boat , picked up the floating mariners , tubs , oars , and whatever else could be caught at , and safely landed them on her decks .
Some <unk> shoulders , wrists , and <unk> ; <unk> <unk> ; wrenched harpoons and lances ; <unk> <unk> of rope ; shattered oars and planks ; all these were there ; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have <unk> any one .
As with Fedallah the day before , so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat ’ s broken half , which afforded a comparatively easy float ; nor did it so <unk> him as the previous day ’ s <unk> .
But when he was helped to the deck , all eyes were fastened upon him ; as instead of standing by himself he still <unk> upon the shoulder of Starbuck , who had thus far been the foremost to <unk> him .
His ivory leg had been snapped off , leaving but one short sharp <unk> .
“ Aye , aye , Starbuck , ’ tis sweet to lean sometimes , be the <unk> who he will ; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has . ” “ The <unk> has not stood , sir , ” said the carpenter , now coming up ; “ I put good work into that leg . ” “ But no bones broken , sir , I hope , ” said Stubb with true concern .
“ Aye !
and all splintered to pieces , Stubb ! — d ’ ye see it . — But even with a broken bone , old Ahab is <unk> ; and I account no living bone of mine one jot more me , than this dead one that ’ s lost .
Nor white whale , nor man , nor fiend , can so much as <unk> old Ahab in his own proper and <unk> being .
Can any lead touch yonder floor , any mast scrape yonder <unk> ? — Aloft there !
which way ? ” “ <unk> to leeward , sir . ” “ Up helm , then ; pile on the sail again , ship <unk> !
down the rest of the spare boats and rig them — Mr.
Starbuck away , and <unk> the boat ’ s crews . ” “ Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks , sir . ” “ Oh , oh , oh !
how this <unk> <unk> me now !
<unk> fate !
that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate ! ” “ Sir ? ” “ My body , man , not thee .
Give me something for a cane — there , that shivered lance will do .
<unk> the men .
Surely I have not seen him yet .
By heaven it cannot be ! — missing ? — quick !
call them all . ” The old man ’ s hinted thought was true .
Upon <unk> the company , the Parsee was not there .
“ The Parsee ! ” cried Stubb — “ he must have been caught in — — ” “ The black <unk> <unk> thee ! — run all of ye above , <unk> , cabin , forecastle — find him — not gone — not gone ! ” But quickly they returned to him with the <unk> that the Parsee was nowhere to be found .
“ Aye , sir , ” said Stubb — “ caught among the <unk> of your line — I thought I saw him dragging under . ” “ _ My _ line !
_ my _ line ?
<unk> ? — gone ?
What means that little word ? — What <unk> rings in it , that old Ahab shakes as if he were the <unk> .
The harpoon , too ! — toss over the <unk> there , — d ’ ye see it ? — the forged iron , men , the white whale ’ s — no , no , no , — <unk> fool !
this hand did dart it ! — ’ tis in the fish ! — Aloft there !
<unk> him nailed — Quick ! — all hands to the rigging of the boats — <unk> the oars — harpooneers !
the irons , the irons ! — hoist the <unk> higher — a pull on all the sheets ! — helm there !
steady , steady for your life !
I ’ ll ten times <unk> the <unk> globe ; yea and dive straight through it , but I ’ ll slay him yet ! ” “ Great God !
but for one single instant show thyself , ” cried Starbuck ; “ never , never wilt thou capture him , old man — In <unk> ’ name no more of this , that ’ s worse than devil ’ s madness .
Two days chased ; twice stove to splinters ; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee ; thy evil shadow gone — all good angels <unk> thee with <unk> : — what more <unk> thou have ? — Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he <unk> the last man ?
Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea ?
Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world ?
Oh , oh , — <unk> and <unk> to hunt him more ! ” “ Starbuck , of late I ’ ve felt strangely moved to thee ; ever since that hour we both saw — thou know ’ st what , in one another ’ s eyes .
But in this matter of the whale , be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this hand — a <unk> , <unk> blank .
Ahab is for ever Ahab , man .
This whole act ’ s <unk> <unk> .
’ <unk> <unk> by thee and me a <unk> years before this ocean rolled .
<unk> !
I am the Fates ’ <unk> ; I act under orders .
Look thou , <unk> !
that thou <unk> mine . — Stand round me , men .
Ye see an old man cut down to the stump ; leaning on a shivered lance ; <unk> up on a lonely foot .
’ Tis Ahab — his body ’ s part ; but Ahab ’ s soul ’ s a <unk> , that <unk> upon a hundred legs .
I feel strained , half stranded , as ropes that tow dismasted <unk> in a gale ; and I may look so .
But ere I break , ye ’ ll hear me crack ; and till ye hear _ that _ , know that Ahab ’ s <unk> <unk> his purpose yet .
<unk> ye , men , in the things called <unk> ?
Then laugh <unk> , and cry <unk> !
For ere they drown , <unk> things will twice rise to the surface ; then rise again , to sink for <unk> .
So with Moby Dick — two days he ’ s floated — <unk> will be the third .
Aye , men , he ’ ll rise once more , — but only to spout his last !
D ’ ye feel brave men , brave ? ” “ As fearless fire , ” cried Stubb .
“ And as mechanical , ” muttered Ahab .
Then as the men went forward , he muttered on : “ The things called <unk> !
And yesterday I talked the same to Starbuck there , concerning my broken boat .
Oh !
how <unk> I seek to drive out of others ’ hearts what ’ s <unk> so fast in mine ! — The Parsee — the Parsee ! — gone , gone ?
and he was to go before : — but still was to be seen again ere I could <unk> — How ’ s that ? — There ’ s a <unk> now might <unk> all the <unk> backed by the ghosts of the whole line of <unk> : — like a <unk> ’ s <unk> it <unk> my brain .
_ I ’ ll _ , _ I ’ ll _ <unk> it , though ! ” When <unk> descended , the whale was still in sight to leeward .
So once more the sail was <unk> , and everything passed nearly as on the previous night ; only , the sound of hammers , and the hum of the <unk> was heard till nearly daylight , as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and <unk> their fresh weapons for the <unk> .
Meantime , of the broken keel of Ahab ’ s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg ; while still as on the night before , slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle ; his <unk> , <unk> glance <unk> gone backward on its <unk> ; sat due eastward for the <unk> sun .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Chase . — Third Day .
The morning of the third day <unk> fair and fresh , and once more the solitary <unk> at the <unk> was relieved by crowds of the daylight look-outs , who dotted every mast and almost every spar .
“ D ’ ye see him ? ” cried Ahab ; but the whale was not yet in sight .
“ In his infallible wake , though ; but follow that wake , that ’ s all .
<unk> there ; steady , as thou <unk> , and hast been going .
What a lovely day again !
were it a <unk> world , and made for a <unk> to the angels , and this morning the first of its throwing open to them , a <unk> day could not dawn upon that world .
Here ’ s food for thought , had Ahab time to think ; but Ahab never thinks ; he only feels , feels , feels ; _ that ’ s _ <unk> enough for mortal man !
to think ’ s <unk> .
God only has that right and privilege .
<unk> is , or ought to be , a <unk> and a <unk> ; and our poor hearts <unk> , and our poor brains beat too much for that .
And yet , I ’ ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm — frozen calm , this old skull cracks so , like a glass in which the contents turned to ice , and shiver it .
And still this hair is growing now ; this moment growing , and heat must <unk> it ; but no , it ’ s like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere , between the <unk> <unk> of Greenland ice or in <unk> <unk> .
How the wild winds blow it ; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they <unk> to .
A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> them , and now comes blowing hither as innocent as <unk> .
Out upon it ! — it ’ s <unk> .
Were I the wind , I ’ d blow no more on such a wicked , miserable world .
I ’ d crawl somewhere to a cave , and <unk> there .
And yet , ’ tis a noble and <unk> thing , the wind !
who ever <unk> it ?
In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow .
<unk> <unk> at it , and you but run through it .
Ha !
a coward wind that strikes stark naked men , but will not stand to receive a single blow .
Even Ahab is a <unk> thing — a <unk> thing than _ that _ .
Would now the wind but had a body ; but all the things that most <unk> and <unk> mortal man , all these things are <unk> , but only <unk> as objects , not as <unk> .
There ’ s a most special , a most cunning , oh , a most malicious difference !
And yet , I say again , and swear it now , that there ’ s something all glorious and gracious in the wind .
These warm <unk> <unk> , at least , that in the clear heavens blow straight on , in strong and steadfast , vigorous mildness ; and <unk> not from their mark , however the <unk> currents of the sea may turn and <unk> , and mightiest <unk> of the land swift and <unk> about , uncertain where to go at last .
And by the eternal <unk> !
these same <unk> that so directly blow my good ship on ; these <unk> , or something like them — something so <unk> , and full as strong , blow my <unk> soul along !
To it !
Aloft there !
What d ’ ye see ? ” “ Nothing , sir . ” “ Nothing !
and noon at hand !
The doubloon goes <unk> !
See the sun !
Aye , aye , it must be so .
I ’ ve <unk> him .
How , got the start ?
Aye , he ’ s chasing _ me _ now ; not I , _ him _ — that ’ s bad ; I might have known it , too .
<unk> !
the lines — the harpoons he ’ s towing .
Aye , aye , I have run him by last night .
About !
about !
Come down , all of ye , but the regular look <unk> !
Man the braces ! ” <unk> as she had done , the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod ’ s quarter , so that now being pointed in the <unk> direction , the <unk> ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she <unk> the <unk> in her own white wake .
“ <unk> the wind he now <unk> for the open jaw , ” murmured Starbuck to himself , as he coiled the <unk> <unk> upon the rail .
“ God keep us , but already my bones feel damp within me , and from the inside wet my flesh .
I <unk> me that I <unk> my God in obeying him ! ” “ Stand by to sway me up ! ” cried Ahab , advancing to the hempen basket .
“ We should meet him soon . ” “ Aye , aye , sir , ” and straightway Starbuck did Ahab ’ s bidding , and once more Ahab swung on high .
A whole hour now passed ; <unk> out to ages .
Time itself now held long breaths with keen <unk> .
But at last , some three points off the weather bow , Ahab descried the spout again , and instantly from the three mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the <unk> of fire had <unk> it .
“ <unk> to forehead I meet thee , this third time , Moby Dick !
On deck there ! — brace <unk> up ; crowd her into the wind ’ s eye .
He ’ s too far off to lower yet , Mr. Starbuck .
The sails shake !
Stand over that helmsman with a top-maul !
So , so ; he <unk> fast , and I must down .
But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea ; there ’ s time for that .
An old , old sight , and yet somehow so young ; aye , and not changed a <unk> since I first saw it , a boy , from the <unk> of Nantucket !
The same ! — the same ! — the same to Noah as to me .
There ’ s a soft shower to leeward .
Such lovely <unk> !
They must lead somewhere — to something else than common land , more <unk> than the palms .
<unk> !
the white whale goes that way ; look to windward , then ; the better if the <unk> quarter .
But good <unk> , good <unk> , old mast-head !
What ’ s this ? — green ?
aye , <unk> <unk> in these <unk> cracks .
No such green weather <unk> on Ahab ’ s head !
There ’ s the difference now between man ’ s old age and matter ’ s .
But aye , old mast , we both grow old together ; sound in our hulls , though , are we not , my ship ?
Aye , <unk> a leg , that ’ s all .
By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way .
I can ’ t compare with it ; and I ’ ve known some ships made of dead trees <unk> the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers .
What ’ s that he said ?
he should still go before me , my pilot ; and yet to be seen again ?
But where ?
Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea , <unk> I descend those endless stairs ?
and all night I ’ ve been sailing from him , wherever he did sink to .
Aye , aye , like many more thou told ’ st direful truth as touching thyself , O Parsee ; but , Ahab , there thy shot fell short .
Good-bye , mast-head — keep a good eye upon the whale , the while I ’ m gone .
We ’ ll talk to-morrow , nay , to-night , when the white whale lies down there , tied by head and tail . ” He gave the word ; and still gazing round him , was steadily lowered through the <unk> blue air to the deck .
In due time the boats were lowered ; but as standing in his <unk> ’ s stern , Ahab just hovered upon the point of the <unk> , he waved to the mate , — who held one of the <unk> on deck — and bade him pause .
“ Starbuck ! ” “ Sir ? ” “ For the third time my soul ’ s ship <unk> upon this voyage , Starbuck . ” “ Aye , sir , thou wilt have it so . ” “ Some ships sail from their ports , and ever afterwards are missing , Starbuck ! ” “ Truth , sir : <unk> truth . ” “ Some men die at <unk> tide ; some at low water ; some at the full of the flood ; — and I feel now like a billow that ’ s all one <unk> <unk> , Starbuck .
I am old ; — shake hands with me , man . ” Their hands met ; their eyes fastened ; Starbuck ’ s tears the <unk> .
“ Oh , my captain , my captain ! — noble heart — go not — go not ! — see , it ’ s a brave man that <unk> ; how great the agony of the <unk> then ! ” “ Lower away ! ” — cried Ahab , tossing the mate ’ s arm from him .
“ Stand by the crew ! ” In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern .
“ The sharks !
the sharks ! ” cried a voice from the low <unk> there ; “ O master , my master , come back ! ” But Ahab heard nothing ; for his own voice was <unk> then ; and the boat leaped on .
Yet the voice <unk> true ; for scarce had he pushed from the ship , when numbers of sharks , seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull , <unk> snapped at the blades of the oars , every time they <unk> in the water ; and in this way accompanied the boat with their <unk> .
It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the <unk> in those <unk> seas ; the sharks at times apparently following them in the same <unk> way that <unk> <unk> over the <unk> of marching <unk> in the east .
But these were the first sharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried ; and whether it was that Ahab ’ s crew were all such <unk> <unk> , and therefore their flesh more <unk> to the <unk> of the sharks — a matter sometimes well known to affect them , — however it was , they seemed to follow that one boat without <unk> the others .
“ <unk> of wrought steel ! ” murmured Starbuck gazing over the side , and following with his eyes the <unk> boat — “ canst thou yet ring boldly to that sight ? — lowering thy keel among <unk> sharks , and followed by them , <unk> to the chase ; and this the critical third day ? — For when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit ; be sure the first is the morning , the second the noon , and the third the evening and the end of that thing — be that end what it may .
Oh !
my God !
what is this that <unk> through me , and leaves me so deadly calm , yet <unk> , — fixed at the top of a shudder !
<unk> things swim before me , as in empty <unk> and skeletons ; all the past is somehow grown dim .
Mary , girl !
thou <unk> in pale <unk> behind me ; boy !
I seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue .
<unk> <unk> of life seem clearing ; but clouds sweep between — Is my <unk> ’ s end coming ?
My legs feel faint ; like his who has <unk> it all day .
<unk> thy heart , — <unk> it yet ?
<unk> thyself , Starbuck ! — stave it off — move , move !
speak <unk> ! — <unk> there !
See ye my boy ’ s hand on the hill ? — <unk> ; — aloft there ! — keep thy <unk> eye upon the boats : — mark well the whale ! — Ho !
again ! — drive off that <unk> !
see !
he <unk> — he tears the <unk> ” — pointing to the red flag flying at the <unk> — “ Ha !
he <unk> away with it ! — Where ’ s the old man now ?
see ’ st thou that sight , oh Ahab ! — shudder , shudder ! ” The boats had not gone very far , when by a signal from the mast-heads — a downward pointed arm , Ahab knew that the whale had sounded ; but <unk> to be near him at the next rising , he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel ; the <unk> crew <unk> the profoundest silence , as the <unk> waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow .
“ <unk> , drive in your nails , oh ye waves !
to their uttermost heads drive them in !
ye but strike a thing without a lid ; and no coffin and no hearse can be mine : — and hemp only can kill me !
Ha !
ha ! ” Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles ; then quickly <unk> , as if sideways sliding from a submerged <unk> of ice , swiftly rising to the surface .
A low <unk> sound was heard ; a <unk> hum ; and then all held their breaths ; as <unk> with <unk> ropes , and harpoons , and lances , a vast form shot lengthwise , but obliquely from the sea .
<unk> in a thin drooping veil of mist , it hovered for a moment in the <unk> air ; and then fell <unk> back into the deep .
<unk> thirty feet upwards , the waters <unk> for an instant like heaps of <unk> , then <unk> sank in a shower of <unk> , leaving the <unk> surface <unk> like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale .
“ Give way ! ” cried Ahab to the oarsmen , and the boats darted forward to the attack ; but maddened by yesterday ’ s fresh irons that <unk> in him , Moby Dick seemed <unk> possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven .
The wide <unk> of welded tendons <unk> his broad white forehead , beneath the transparent skin , looked <unk> together ; as head on , he came churning his tail among the boats ; and once more <unk> them apart ; <unk> out the irons and lances from the two mates ’ boats , and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows , but leaving Ahab ’ s almost without a scar .
While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks ; and as the whale swimming out from them , turned , and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again ; at that moment a quick cry went up .
<unk> round and round to the fish ’ s back ; <unk> in the turns upon turns in which , during the past night , the whale had reeled the <unk> of the lines around him , the half torn body of the Parsee was seen ; his sable <unk> <unk> to shreds ; his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab .
The harpoon dropped from his hand .
“ <unk> , <unk> ! ” — drawing in a long lean breath — “ Aye , Parsee !
I see thee again . — Aye , and thou <unk> before ; and this , _ this _ then is the hearse that thou didst promise .
But I hold thee to the last letter of thy word .
Where is the second hearse ?
Away , mates , to the ship !
those boats are useless now ; <unk> them if ye can in time , and return to me ; if not , Ahab is enough to die — Down , men !
the first thing that but <unk> to jump from this boat I stand in , that thing I harpoon .
Ye are not other men , but my arms and my legs ; and so obey me . — Where ’ s the whale ?
gone down again ? ” But he looked too nigh the boat ; for as if bent upon <unk> with the corpse he bore , and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage , Moby Dick was now again steadily swimming forward ; and had almost passed the ship , — which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him , though for the present her headway had been stopped .
He seemed swimming with his utmost velocity , and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea .
“ Oh !
Ahab , ” cried Starbuck , “ not too late is it , even now , the third day , to desist .
See !
Moby Dick seeks thee not .
It is thou , thou , that <unk> <unk> him ! ” <unk> sail to the rising wind , the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to leeward , by both oars and canvas .
And at last when Ahab was sliding by the vessel , so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck ’ s face as he leaned over the rail , he hailed him to turn the vessel about , and follow him , not too swiftly , at a <unk> interval .
<unk> upwards , he saw Tashtego , Queequeg , and Daggoo , eagerly <unk> to the three mast-heads ; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two <unk> boats which had but just been hoisted to the side , and were <unk> at work in <unk> them .
One after the other , through the <unk> , as he <unk> , he also caught flying <unk> of Stubb and Flask , <unk> themselves on deck among <unk> of new irons and lances .
As he saw all this ; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats ; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart .
But he <unk> .
And now <unk> that the <unk> or flag was gone from the <unk> , he shouted to Tashtego , who had just gained that perch , to descend again for another flag , and a hammer and nails , and so nail it to the mast .
Whether <unk> by the three days ’ running chase , and the <unk> to his swimming in the knotted <unk> he bore ; or whether it was some latent <unk> and malice in him : <unk> was true , the White Whale ’ s way now began to <unk> , as it seemed , from the boat so rapidly <unk> him once more ; though indeed the whale ’ s last start had not been so long a one as before .
And still as Ahab glided over the waves the <unk> sharks accompanied him ; and so <unk> stuck to the boat ; and so continually bit at the <unk> oars , that the blades became <unk> and <unk> , and left small splinters in the sea , at almost every dip .
“ <unk> them not !
those teeth but give new <unk> to your oars .
Pull on !
’ tis the better rest , the shark ’ s jaw than the <unk> water . ” “ But at every <unk> , sir , the thin blades grow smaller and smaller ! ” “ They will last long enough !
pull on ! — But who can tell ” — he muttered — “ whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on Ahab ? — But pull on !
Aye , all alive , now — we near him .
The helm !
take the helm !
let me pass , ” — and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat .
At length as the craft was cast to one side , and ran ranging along with the White Whale ’ s flank , he seemed strangely <unk> of its advance — as the whale sometimes will — and Ahab was fairly within the <unk> mountain mist , which , thrown off from the whale ’ s spout , curled round his great , <unk> hump ; he was even thus close to him ; when , with body arched back , and both arms lengthwise <unk> to the <unk> , he darted his fierce iron , and his far <unk> <unk> into the hated whale .
As both steel and <unk> sank to the socket , as if sucked into a <unk> , Moby Dick sideways <unk> ; <unk> rolled his nigh flank against the bow , and , without <unk> a hole in it , so suddenly <unk> the boat over , that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then <unk> , Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea .
As it was , three of the oarsmen — who <unk> not the precise instant of the dart , and were therefore <unk> for its <unk> — these were flung out ; but so fell , that , in an instant two of them <unk> the gunwale again , and rising to its level on a <unk> wave , hurled themselves bodily <unk> again ; the third man <unk> dropping astern , but still afloat and swimming .
Almost simultaneously , with a mighty volition of <unk> , instantaneous swiftness , the White Whale darted through the <unk> sea .
But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line , and hold it so ; and commanded the crew to turn round on their <unk> , and tow the boat up to the mark ; the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and <unk> , it snapped in the empty air !
“ What breaks in me ?
Some <unk> cracks ! — ’ tis whole again ; oars !
oars !
<unk> in upon him ! ” <unk> the tremendous rush of the <unk> boat , the whale <unk> round to present his blank forehead at bay ; but in that <unk> , catching sight of the <unk> black hull of the ship ; seemingly seeing in it the source of all his <unk> ; bethinking it — it may be — a larger and <unk> foe ; of a sudden , he bore down upon its advancing prow , smiting his jaws amid fiery <unk> of foam .
Ahab <unk> ; his hand smote his forehead .
“ I grow blind ; hands !
stretch out before me that I may yet <unk> my way .
Is ’ t night ? ” “ The whale !
The ship ! ” cried the <unk> oarsmen .
“ <unk> !
oars !
<unk> downwards to thy depths , O sea , that ere it be for ever too late , Ahab may slide this last , last time upon his mark !
I see : the ship !
the ship !
<unk> on , my men !
Will ye not save my ship ? ” But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the <unk> seas , the before <unk> <unk> of two planks burst through , and in an instant almost , the temporarily <unk> boat lay nearly level with the waves ; its <unk> , <unk> crew , trying hard to stop the <unk> and <unk> out the <unk> water .
Meantime , for that one beholding instant , Tashtego ’ s mast-head hammer remained suspended in his hand ; and the red flag , <unk> him as with a <unk> , then <unk> itself straight out from him , as his own <unk> heart ; while Starbuck and Stubb , standing upon the bowsprit beneath , caught sight of the <unk> monster just as soon as he .
“ The whale , the whale !
Up helm , up helm !
Oh , all ye sweet powers of air , now <unk> me close !
Let not Starbuck die , if die he must , in a woman ’ s <unk> fit .
Up helm , I say — ye <unk> , the jaw !
the jaw !
Is this the end of all my bursting prayers ?
all my <unk> <unk> ?
Oh , Ahab , Ahab , lo , thy work .
Steady !
helmsman , steady .
Nay , nay !
Up helm again !
He turns to meet us !
Oh , his <unk> brow <unk> on towards one , whose duty tells him he cannot depart .
My God , stand by me now ! ” “ Stand not by me , but stand under me , whoever you are that will now help Stubb ; for Stubb , too , <unk> here .
I grin at thee , thou grinning whale !
Who ever helped Stubb , or kept Stubb awake , but Stubb ’ s own <unk> eye ?
And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a <unk> that is all too soft ; would it were stuffed with <unk> !
I grin at thee , thou grinning whale !
Look ye , sun , moon , and stars !
I call ye <unk> of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost .
For all that , I would yet ring glasses with ye , would ye but hand the cup !
Oh , oh !
oh , oh !
thou grinning whale , but there ’ ll be plenty of <unk> soon !
Why fly ye not , O Ahab !
For me , off shoes and jacket to it ; let Stubb die in his drawers !
A most mouldy and over salted death , though ; — <unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> !
Oh , Flask , for one red <unk> ere we die ! ” “ <unk> ?
I only wish that we were where they grow .
Oh , Stubb , I hope my poor mother ’ s drawn my <unk> ere this ; if not , few <unk> will now come to her , for the voyage is up . ” From the ship ’ s bows , nearly all the seamen now hung <unk> ; hammers , bits of plank , lances , and harpoons , mechanically retained in their hands , just as they had darted from their various <unk> ; all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale , which from side to side strangely vibrating his <unk> head , sent a broad band of <unk> <unk> foam before him as he rushed .
<unk> , swift vengeance , eternal malice were in his whole aspect , and spite of all that mortal man could do , the solid white <unk> of his forehead smote the ship ’ s starboard bow , till men and timbers reeled .
Some fell flat upon their faces .
Like <unk> <unk> , the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their <unk> <unk> .
Through the <unk> , they heard the waters pour , as mountain <unk> down a <unk> .
“ The ship !
The hearse ! — the second hearse ! ” cried Ahab from the boat ; “ its wood could only be American ! ” <unk> beneath the <unk> ship , the whale ran <unk> along its keel ; but turning under water , swiftly shot to the surface again , far off the other bow , but within a few yards of Ahab ’ s boat , where , for a time , he lay <unk> .
“ I turn my body from the sun .
What ho , Tashtego !
let me hear thy hammer .
Oh !
ye three <unk> spires of mine ; thou <unk> keel ; and only <unk> hull ; thou firm deck , and haughty helm , and <unk> prow , — <unk> ship !
must ye then <unk> , and without me ?
<unk> I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest <unk> captains ?
Oh , lonely death on lonely life !
Oh , now I feel my topmost <unk> lies in my topmost grief .
Ho , ho !
from all your furthest <unk> , pour ye now in , ye bold billows of my whole <unk> life , and top this one piled <unk> of my death !
Towards thee I roll , thou <unk> but <unk> whale ; to the last I <unk> with thee ; from hell ’ s heart I <unk> at thee ; for hate ’ s sake I <unk> my last breath at thee .
<unk> all coffins and all <unk> to one common pool !
and since neither can be mine , let me then tow to pieces , while still chasing thee , though tied to thee , thou damned whale !
_ Thus _ , I give up the spear ! ” The harpoon was darted ; the stricken whale flew forward ; with <unk> velocity the line ran through the grooves ; — ran foul .
Ahab stooped to clear it ; he did clear it ; but the flying turn caught him round the neck , and <unk> as Turkish <unk> <unk> their <unk> , he was shot out of the boat , ere the crew knew he was gone .
Next instant , the heavy <unk> in the rope ’ s final end flew out of the <unk> tub , knocked down an oarsman , and smiting the sea , disappeared in its depths .
For an instant , the <unk> boat ’ s crew stood still ; then turned .
“ The ship ?
Great God , where is the ship ? ” Soon they through dim , <unk> <unk> saw her sidelong <unk> phantom , as in the <unk> <unk> <unk> ; only the <unk> masts out of water ; while fixed by <unk> , or <unk> , or fate , to their once lofty <unk> , the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking <unk> on the sea .
And now , <unk> circles seized the lone boat itself , and all its crew , and each floating oar , and every <unk> , and spinning , <unk> and <unk> , all round and round in one <unk> , carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight .
But as the last <unk> <unk> poured themselves over the sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast , leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible , together with long <unk> yards of the flag , which calmly <unk> , with <unk> <unk> , over the <unk> billows they almost touched ; — at that instant , a red arm and a hammer hovered <unk> uplifted in the open air , in the act of <unk> the flag <unk> and yet <unk> to the <unk> spar .
A <unk> that <unk> had followed the <unk> downwards from its natural home among the stars , <unk> at the flag , and <unk> Tashtego there ; this bird now chanced to <unk> its broad <unk> wing between the hammer and the wood ; and simultaneously feeling that <unk> <unk> , the submerged savage beneath , in his <unk> , kept his hammer frozen there ; and so the bird of heaven , with <unk> shrieks , and his imperial <unk> thrust upwards , and his whole <unk> form folded in the flag of Ahab , went down with his ship , which , like <unk> , would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her , and <unk> herself with it .
Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet <unk> gulf ; a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides ; then all <unk> , and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago .
<unk> “ AND I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> TO <unk> <unk> ” Job .
The <unk> ’ s done .
Why then here does any one step forth ? — Because one did survive the wreck .
It so chanced , that after the Parsee ’ s <unk> , I was he whom the Fates <unk> to take the place of Ahab ’ s bowsman , when that bowsman <unk> the vacant post ; the same , who , when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat , was dropped astern .
So , floating on the margin of the <unk> scene , and in full sight of it , when the <unk> <unk> of the sunk ship reached me , I was then , but slowly , drawn towards the <unk> <unk> .
When I reached it , it had <unk> to a creamy pool .
Round and round , then , and ever <unk> towards the <unk> black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle , like another <unk> I did <unk> .
<unk> , gaining that vital centre , the black bubble upward burst ; and now , <unk> by reason of its cunning spring , and , owing to its great <unk> , rising with great force , the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea , fell over , and floated by my side .
<unk> up by that coffin , for almost one whole day and night , I floated on a soft and <unk> main .
The <unk> sharks , they glided by as if with <unk> on their mouths ; the savage <unk> sailed with <unk> <unk> .
