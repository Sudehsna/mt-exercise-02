It will be seen that this mere <unk> <unk> and <unk> of a poor devil of a <unk> appears to have gone through the long <unk> and <unk> of the earth , picking up whatever random allusions to whales he could <unk> find in any book whatsoever , sacred or profane .
Therefore you must not , in every case at least , take the <unk> whale statements , however <unk> , in these extracts , for veritable <unk> cetology .
Far from it .
As touching the ancient <unk> generally , as well as the <unk> here <unk> , these extracts are solely valuable or <unk> , as <unk> a glancing bird ’ s eye view of what has been <unk> said , thought , fancied , and <unk> of Leviathan , by many nations and generations , including our own .
So fare thee well , poor devil of a <unk> , whose <unk> I am .
Thou <unk> to that hopeless , <unk> tribe which no wine of this world will ever warm ; and for whom even <unk> <unk> would be too <unk> ; but with whom one sometimes <unk> to sit , and feel <unk> , too ; and grow convivial upon tears ; and say to them <unk> , with full eyes and empty glasses , and in not altogether <unk> <unk> — Give it up , <unk> !
For by how much the more pains ye take to please the world , by so much the more shall ye for ever go <unk> !
Would that I could clear out <unk> <unk> and the <unk> for ye !
But <unk> down your tears and <unk> aloft to the <unk> with your hearts ; for your friends who have gone before are clearing out the <unk> heavens , and making <unk> of <unk> Gabriel , <unk> , and <unk> , against your coming .
Here ye strike but splintered hearts together — there , ye shall strike <unk> glasses !

<unk> I find myself growing grim about the mouth ; whenever it is a damp , <unk> <unk> in my soul ; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin <unk> , and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet ; and especially whenever my <unk> get such an upper hand of me , that it requires a strong <unk> principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street , and <unk> knocking people ’ s hats off — then , I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can .
This is my <unk> for pistol and ball .
With a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> himself upon his sword ; I quietly take to the ship .
There is nothing surprising in this .
If they but knew it , almost all men in their degree , some time or other , cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me .
There now is your insular city of the <unk> , <unk> round by wharves as Indian isles by coral <unk> — commerce <unk> it with her surf .
Right and left , the streets take you <unk> .
<unk> extreme <unk> is the <unk> , where that noble <unk> is washed by waves , and <unk> by breezes , which a few hours previous were out of sight of land .
Look at the crowds of <unk> there .
<unk> the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon .
Go from <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , and from thence , by <unk> , northward .
What do you see ? — <unk> like silent <unk> all around the town , stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries .
Some leaning against the <unk> ; some seated upon the <unk> ; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China ; some high aloft in the rigging , as if striving to get a still better <unk> peep .
But these are all landsmen ; of week days <unk> up in <unk> and <unk> — tied to <unk> , nailed to <unk> , <unk> to <unk> .
How then is this ?
Are the green fields gone ?
What do they here ?
But look !
here come more crowds , pacing straight for the water , and seemingly bound for a dive .
<unk> !
Nothing will content them but the <unk> limit of the land ; <unk> under the <unk> lee of yonder <unk> will not <unk> .
No .
They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in .
And there they stand — miles of them — leagues .
<unk> all , they come from <unk> and <unk> , streets and <unk> — north , east , south , and west .
Yet here they all unite .
Tell me , does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships <unk> them thither ?
Once more .
Say you are in the country ; in some high land of <unk> .
Take almost any path you please , and ten to one it carries you down in a <unk> , and leaves you there by a pool in the stream .
There is magic in it .
Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries — stand that man on his legs , set his feet <unk> , and he will infallibly lead you to water , if water there be in all that region .
<unk> you ever be <unk> in the great American desert , try this experiment , if your <unk> happen to be supplied with a <unk> professor .
Yes , as every one knows , meditation and water are wedded for ever .
But here is an artist .
He desires to paint you the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , most <unk> bit of romantic <unk> in all the valley of the <unk> .
What is the chief element he <unk> ?
There stand his trees , each with a hollow trunk , as if a <unk> and a <unk> were within ; and here sleeps his meadow , and there sleep his cattle ; and up from yonder <unk> goes a sleepy smoke .
<unk> into distant <unk> winds a <unk> way , reaching to <unk> <unk> of mountains <unk> in their <unk> blue .
But though the picture lies thus <unk> , and though this <unk> shakes down its <unk> like leaves upon this <unk> ’ s head , yet all were vain , unless the <unk> ’ s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him .
Go visit the <unk> in <unk> , when for scores on scores of miles you <unk> <unk> among <unk> — what is the one charm wanting ? — Water — there is not a drop of water there !
Were <unk> but a <unk> of sand , would you travel your thousand miles to see it ?
Why did the poor <unk> of <unk> , upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver , deliberate whether to <unk> him a coat , which he sadly needed , or invest his money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> ?
Why is almost every <unk> healthy boy with a <unk> healthy soul in him , at some time or other crazy to go to sea ?
Why upon your first voyage as a passenger , did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration , when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land ?
Why did the old <unk> hold the sea holy ?
Why did the <unk> give it a separate <unk> , and own brother of Jove ?
Surely all this is not without meaning .
And still deeper the meaning of that story of <unk> , who because he could not grasp the <unk> , mild image he saw in the fountain , plunged into it and was drowned .
But that same image , we ourselves see in all <unk> and oceans .
It is the image of the <unk> phantom of life ; and this is the key to it all .
Now , when I say that I am in the <unk> of going to sea whenever I begin to grow <unk> about the eyes , and begin to be over conscious of my lungs , I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger .
For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse , and a purse is but a <unk> unless you have something in it .
Besides , passengers get <unk> — grow <unk> — don ’ t sleep of nights — do not enjoy themselves much , as a general thing ; — no , I never go as a passenger ; nor , though I am something of a salt , do I ever go to sea as a Commodore , or a Captain , or a Cook .
I <unk> the glory and distinction of such <unk> to those who like them .
For my part , I <unk> all honorable <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> of every kind whatsoever .
It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself , without taking care of ships , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and what not .
And as for going as cook , — though I confess there is considerable glory in that , a cook being a sort of officer on <unk> — yet , somehow , I never fancied <unk> fowls ; — though once <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> salted and <unk> , there is no one who will speak more respectfully , not to say <unk> , of a <unk> fowl than I will .
It is out of the <unk> <unk> of the old Egyptians upon <unk> <unk> and <unk> river horse , that you see the <unk> of those creatures in their huge <unk> the <unk> .
No , when I go to sea , I go as a simple sailor , right before the mast , <unk> down into the forecastle , aloft there to the royal mast-head .
True , they rather order me about some , and make me jump from spar to spar , like a <unk> in a May meadow .
And at first , this sort of thing is <unk> enough .
It <unk> one ’ s sense of honor , particularly if you come of an old <unk> family in the land , the <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> .
And more than all , if just previous to putting your hand into the <unk> , you have been <unk> it as a country schoolmaster , making the <unk> boys stand in awe of you .
The transition is a keen one , I assure you , from a schoolmaster to a sailor , and requires a strong <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> to enable you to grin and bear it .
But even this wears off in time .
What of it , if some old <unk> of a <unk> orders me to get a <unk> and sweep down the decks ?
What does that <unk> amount to , <unk> , I mean , in the scales of the New <unk> ?
Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me , because I <unk> and respectfully obey that old <unk> in that particular instance ?
Who ain ’ t a slave ?
Tell me that .
Well , then , however the old <unk> may order me about — however they may thump and punch me about , I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right ; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way — either in a physical or <unk> point of view , that is ; and so the universal thump is passed round , and all hands should <unk> each other ’ s <unk> , and be content .
Again , I always go to sea as a sailor , because they make a point of paying me for my trouble , whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of .
On the contrary , passengers themselves must pay .
And there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid .
The act of paying is perhaps the most <unk> <unk> that the two <unk> <unk> <unk> upon us .
But _ being paid _ , — what will compare with it ?
The <unk> activity with which a man <unk> money is really marvellous , considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly <unk> , and that on no account can a <unk> man enter heaven .
Ah !
how <unk> we <unk> ourselves to <unk> !
<unk> , I always go to sea as a sailor , because of the <unk> <unk> and pure air of the <unk> deck .
For as in this world , head winds are far more <unk> than winds from astern ( that is , if you never <unk> the <unk> <unk> ) , so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle .
He thinks he breathes it first ; but not so .
In much the same way do the <unk> lead their <unk> in many other things , at the same time that the <unk> little <unk> it .
But wherefore it was that after having <unk> <unk> the sea as a merchant sailor , I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage ; this the invisible <unk> officer of the Fates , who has the constant <unk> of me , and <unk> dogs me , and influences me in some unaccountable way — he can better answer than any one else .
And , doubtless , my going on this whaling voyage , formed part of the grand <unk> of <unk> that was drawn up a long time ago .
It came in as a sort of brief interlude and <unk> between more <unk> performances .
I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this : “ _ Grand <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of the United States . _ “ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
“ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . ” Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage <unk> , the Fates , put me down for this <unk> part of a whaling voyage , when others were set down for <unk> parts in high <unk> , and short and easy parts in <unk> <unk> , and jolly parts in <unk> — though I cannot tell why this was exactly ; yet , now that I recall all the circumstances , I think I can see a little into the <unk> and motives which being <unk> presented to me under various <unk> , induced me to set about performing the part I did , besides <unk> me into the <unk> that it was a choice <unk> from my own <unk> <unk> and <unk> judgment .
Chief among these motives was the <unk> idea of the great whale himself .
Such a portentous and mysterious monster <unk> all my curiosity .
Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk ; the <unk> , nameless perils of the whale ; these , with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds , helped to sway me to my wish .
With other men , perhaps , such things would not have been <unk> ; but as for me , I am tormented with an everlasting <unk> for things remote .
I love to sail <unk> seas , and land on <unk> coasts .
Not <unk> what is good , I am quick to perceive a horror , and could still be social with it — would they let me — since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the <unk> of the place one <unk> in .
By reason of these things , then , the whaling voyage was welcome ; the great <unk> of the <unk> swung open , and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose , two and two there floated into my <unk> soul , endless <unk> of the whale , and , <unk> most of them all , one grand hooded phantom , like a snow hill in the air .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
I stuffed a shirt or two into my old <unk> , <unk> it under my arm , and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific .
<unk> the good city of old <unk> , I duly arrived in New Bedford .
It was a Saturday night in December .
Much was I <unk> upon learning that the little <unk> for Nantucket had already sailed , and that no way of reaching that place would offer , till the following <unk> .
As most young <unk> for the pains and <unk> of whaling stop at this same New Bedford , thence to embark on their voyage , it may as well be related that I , for one , had no idea of so doing .
For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft , because there was a fine , <unk> something about everything connected with that famous old island , which <unk> pleased me .
Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually <unk> the business of whaling , and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her , yet Nantucket was her great original — the <unk> of this <unk> ; — the place where the first dead American whale was stranded .
Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen , the <unk> , first <unk> out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan ?
And where but from Nantucket , too , did that first adventurous little <unk> put forth , partly laden with <unk> <unk> — so goes the story — to throw at the whales , in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit ?
Now having a night , a day , and still another night following before me in New Bedford , ere I could embark for my destined port , it became a matter of <unk> where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile .
It was a very <unk> , nay , a very dark and dismal night , <unk> cold and <unk> .
I knew no one in the place .
With anxious <unk> I had sounded my pocket , and only brought up a few pieces of silver , — So , wherever you go , Ishmael , said I to myself , as I stood in the middle of a dreary street <unk> my bag , and <unk> the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south — wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to <unk> for the night , my dear Ishmael , be sure to <unk> the <unk> , and don ’ t be too particular .
With <unk> steps I paced the streets , and passed the sign of “ The <unk> <unk> ” — but it looked too <unk> and jolly there .
<unk> on , from the bright red windows of the “ <unk> Inn , ” there came such <unk> rays , that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house , for everywhere else the <unk> frost lay ten inches thick in a hard , <unk> <unk> , — rather weary for me , when I struck my foot against the <unk> <unk> , because from hard , remorseless service the <unk> of my boots were in a most miserable plight .
<unk> <unk> and jolly , again thought I , pausing one moment to watch the broad <unk> in the street , and hear the sounds of the <unk> glasses within .
But go on , Ishmael , said I at last ; don ’ t you hear ?
get away from before the door ; your patched boots are stopping the way .
So on I went .
I now by instinct followed the streets that took me <unk> , for there , doubtless , were the <unk> , if not the <unk> <unk> .
Such dreary streets !
blocks of blackness , not houses , on either hand , and here and there a candle , like a candle moving about in a tomb .
At this hour of the night , of the last day of the week , that quarter of the town proved all but deserted .
But presently I came to a <unk> light proceeding from a low , wide <unk> , the door of which stood <unk> open .
It had a careless look , as if it were meant for the uses of the public ; so , entering , the first thing I did was to <unk> over an <unk> in the <unk> .
Ha !
thought I , ha , as the flying <unk> almost <unk> me , are these ashes from that destroyed city , <unk> ?
But “ The <unk> <unk> , ” and “ The <unk> ? ” — this , then must needs be the sign of “ The <unk> . ” However , I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within , pushed on and opened a second , interior door .
It seemed the great Black <unk> sitting in <unk> .
A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to <unk> ; and beyond , a black <unk> of <unk> was beating a book in a pulpit .
It was a negro church ; and the preacher ’ s text was about the blackness of darkness , and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> there .
Ha , Ishmael , muttered I , backing out , <unk> <unk> at the sign of ‘ The <unk> ! ’ <unk> on , I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks , and heard a <unk> <unk> in the air ; and looking up , saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it , <unk> representing a tall straight jet of <unk> spray , and these words <unk> — “ The <unk> Inn : — Peter Coffin . ” Coffin ? — <unk> ? — Rather <unk> in that particular connexion , thought I.
But it is a common name in Nantucket , they say , and I suppose this Peter here is an <unk> from there .
As the light looked so dim , and the place , for the time , looked quiet enough , and the <unk> little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been <unk> here from the <unk> of some burnt <unk> , and as the swinging sign had a <unk> sort of <unk> to it , I thought that here was the very spot for <unk> <unk> , and the best of <unk> <unk> .
It was a queer sort of place — a <unk> old house , one side <unk> as it were , and leaning over sadly .
It stood on a sharp <unk> corner , where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paul ’ s tossed craft .
Euroclydon , nevertheless , is a mighty pleasant <unk> to any one <unk> , with his feet on the <unk> quietly <unk> for bed .
“ In <unk> of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon , ” says an old <unk> — of whose works I possess the only copy <unk> — “ it maketh a marvellous difference , whether thou <unk> out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside , or whether thou <unk> it from that <unk> window , where the frost is on both sides , and of which the wight Death is the only <unk> . ” True enough , thought I , as this passage occurred to my mind — old <unk> , thou <unk> well .
Yes , these eyes are windows , and this body of mine is the house .
What a pity they didn ’ t stop up the <unk> and the <unk> though , and thrust in a little <unk> here and there .
But it ’ s too late to make any <unk> now .
The universe is finished ; the <unk> is on , and the chips were <unk> off a <unk> years ago .
Poor Lazarus there , <unk> his teeth against the <unk> for his pillow , and shaking off his <unk> with his <unk> , he might <unk> up both ears with <unk> , and put a <unk> into his mouth , and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon .
Euroclydon !
says old <unk> , in his red <unk> <unk> — ( he had a <unk> one afterwards ) <unk> , <unk> !
What a fine frosty night ; how <unk> <unk> ; what northern lights !
Let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting <unk> ; give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals .
But what thinks Lazarus ?
Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights ?
Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here ?
Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator ; yea , ye gods !
go down to the fiery pit itself , in order to keep out this frost ?
Now , that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the <unk> before the door of <unk> , this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the <unk> .
Yet <unk> himself , he too lives like a Czar in an ice <unk> made of frozen <unk> , and being a <unk> of a <unk> society , he only <unk> the <unk> tears of orphans .
But no more of this <unk> now , we are going a-whaling , and there is plenty of that yet to come .
Let us scrape the ice from our <unk> feet , and see what sort of a place this “ <unk> ” may be .
CHAPTER 3 .
The Spouter-Inn .
<unk> that <unk> Spouter-Inn , you found yourself in a wide , low , <unk> entry with old-fashioned <unk> , <unk> one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft .
On one side hung a very large <unk> so <unk> <unk> , and every way <unk> , that in the <unk> <unk> by which you viewed it , it was only by <unk> study and a series of <unk> visits to it , and careful inquiry of the <unk> , that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose .
Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows , that at first you almost thought some <unk> young artist , in the time of the New England <unk> , had <unk> to <unk> chaos <unk> .
But by <unk> of much and earnest <unk> , and <unk> repeated <unk> , and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry , you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea , however wild , might not be altogether <unk> .
But what most <unk> and confounded you was a long , limber , portentous , black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue , dim , perpendicular lines floating in a nameless <unk> .
A <unk> , <unk> , <unk> picture truly , enough to drive a nervous man distracted .
Yet was there a sort of indefinite , <unk> , unimaginable <unk> about it that fairly <unk> you to it , till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant .
<unk> and anon a bright , but , alas , <unk> idea would dart you through . — It ’ s the Black Sea in a midnight gale . — It ’ s the unnatural <unk> of the four primal elements . — It ’ s a blasted <unk> . — It ’ s a <unk> winter scene . — It ’ s the <unk> of the <unk> stream of Time .
But at last all these <unk> <unk> to that one portentous something in the picture ’ s midst .
_ That _ once found out , and all the rest were plain .
But stop ; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish ?
even the great leviathan himself ?
In fact , the artist ’ s design seemed this : a final theory of my own , partly based upon the <unk> <unk> of many aged persons with whom I <unk> upon the subject .
The picture <unk> a <unk> in a great <unk> ; the <unk> ship <unk> there with its three <unk> masts alone visible ; and an exasperated whale , <unk> to spring clean over the craft , is in the enormous act of <unk> himself upon the three mast-heads .
The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous <unk> and spears .
Some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory <unk> ; others were tufted with <unk> of human hair ; and one was <unk> , with a vast handle sweeping round like the <unk> made in the <unk> grass by a <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> as you gazed , and <unk> what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a <unk> with such a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> with these were <unk> old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and <unk> .
Some were <unk> weapons .
With this once long lance , now wildly <unk> , fifty years ago did <unk> <unk> kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset .
And that harpoon — so like a <unk> now — was flung in <unk> seas , and run away with by a whale , years afterwards slain off the Cape of <unk> .
The original iron entered nigh the tail , and , like a <unk> needle <unk> in the body of a man , <unk> full forty feet , and at last was found <unk> in the hump .
<unk> this dusky entry , and on through yon <unk> way — cut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with <unk> all round — you enter the public room .
A still <unk> place is this , with such low ponderous beams above , and such old wrinkled planks beneath , that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft ’ s <unk> , especially of such a howling night , when this <unk> old ark rocked so furiously .
On one side stood a long , low , <unk> table covered with cracked glass cases , filled with <unk> <unk> gathered from this wide world ’ s remotest <unk> .
<unk> from the further angle of the room stands a <unk> den — the bar — a rude attempt at a right whale ’ s head .
Be that how it may , there stands the vast arched bone of the whale ’ s jaw , so wide , a <unk> might almost drive beneath it .
<unk> are <unk> <unk> , ranged round with old <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ; and in those jaws of swift destruction , like another cursed Jonah ( by which name indeed they called him ) , <unk> a little <unk> old man , who , for their money , <unk> <unk> the sailors <unk> and death .
<unk> are the <unk> into which he <unk> his poison .
Though true <unk> without — within , the <unk> green <unk> glasses <unk> <unk> downwards to a <unk> bottom .
<unk> meridians <unk> <unk> into the glass , <unk> these <unk> ’ <unk> .
<unk> to _ this _ mark , and your charge is but a penny ; to _ this _ a penny more ; and so on to the full glass — the Cape Horn measure , which you may <unk> down for a <unk> .
Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a table , <unk> by a dim light divers <unk> of _ <unk> _ .
I sought the landlord , and telling him I desired to be <unk> with a room , received for answer that his house was full — not a bed <unk> .
“ But avast , ” he added , <unk> his forehead , “ you <unk> no <unk> to sharing a harpooneer ’ s blanket , have ye ?
I s ’ <unk> you are goin ’ <unk> ’ , so you ’ d better get used to that sort of thing . ” I told him that I never <unk> to sleep two in a bed ; that if I should ever do so , it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be , and that if he ( the landlord ) really had no other place for me , and the harpooneer was not <unk> <unk> , why rather than <unk> further about a strange town on so bitter a night , I would put up with the half of any decent man ’ s blanket .
“ I thought so .
All right ; take a seat .
Supper ? — you want supper ?
Supper ’ ll be ready directly . ” I sat down on an old wooden settle , carved all over like a bench on the <unk> .
At one end a <unk> tar was still further <unk> it with his jack-knife , stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs .
He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail , but he didn ’ t make much headway , I thought .
At last some four or five of us were summoned to our <unk> in an <unk> room .
It was cold as <unk> — no fire at all — the landlord said he couldn ’ t afford it .
Nothing but two dismal <unk> candles , each in a winding sheet .
We were fain to <unk> up our monkey jackets , and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers .
But the fare was of the most <unk> kind — not only meat and <unk> , but dumplings ; good heavens !
dumplings for supper !
One young fellow in a green box coat , addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner .
“ My boy , ” said the landlord , “ you ’ ll have the <unk> to a dead <unk> . ” “ Landlord , ” I whispered , “ that <unk> the harpooneer is it ? ” “ Oh , no , ” said he , looking a sort of <unk> funny , “ the harpooneer is a dark <unk> chap .
He never <unk> dumplings , he don ’ t — he <unk> nothing but <unk> , and he <unk> ’ em rare . ” “ The devil he does , ” says I.
“ Where is that harpooneer ?
Is he here ? ” “ He ’ ll be here afore long , ” was the answer .
I could not help it , but I began to feel suspicious of this “ dark <unk> ” harpooneer .
At any rate , I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together , he must <unk> and get into bed before I did .
Supper over , the company went back to the bar-room , when , knowing not what else to do with myself , I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a <unk> on .
Presently a <unk> noise was heard without .
<unk> up , the landlord cried , “ That ’ s the Grampus ’ s crew .
I <unk> her reported in the offing this morning ; a three years ’ voyage , and a full ship .
Hurrah , boys ; now we ’ ll have the <unk> news from the <unk> . ” A <unk> of sea boots was heard in the entry ; the door was flung open , and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough .
<unk> in their shaggy watch <unk> , and with their heads muffled in woollen <unk> , all <unk> and ragged , and their <unk> stiff with <unk> , they seemed an <unk> of bears from <unk> .
They had just landed from their boat , and this was the first house they entered .
No wonder , then , that they made a straight wake for the whale ’ s mouth — the bar — when the wrinkled little old Jonah , there <unk> , soon poured them out <unk> all round .
One <unk> of a bad cold in his head , upon which Jonah mixed him a <unk> <unk> of gin and <unk> , which he swore was a <unk> <unk> for all <unk> and <unk> whatsoever , never mind of how long standing , or whether caught off the coast of <unk> , or on the weather side of an <unk> .
The <unk> soon mounted into their heads , as it generally does even with the <unk> <unk> newly landed from sea , and they began <unk> about most <unk> .
I observed , however , that one of them held somewhat <unk> , and though he seemed <unk> not to spoil the <unk> of his shipmates by his own sober face , yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest .
This man <unk> me at once ; and since the <unk> had <unk> that he should soon become my shipmate ( though but a <unk> one , so far as this narrative is concerned ) , I will here venture upon a little description of him .
He stood full six feet in height , with noble shoulders , and a chest like a <unk> .
I have seldom seen such <unk> in a man .
His face was deeply brown and burnt , making his white teeth <unk> by the contrast ; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some <unk> that did not seem to give him much joy .
His voice at once announced that he was a <unk> , and from his fine <unk> , I thought he must be one of those tall <unk> from the <unk> <unk> in Virginia .
When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height , this man slipped away <unk> , and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea .
In a few minutes , however , he was <unk> by his shipmates , and being , it seems , for some reason a huge favourite with them , they raised a cry of “ Bulkington !
Bulkington !
where ’ s Bulkington ? ” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him .
It was now about nine o ’ clock , and the room seeming almost <unk> quiet after these <unk> , I began to <unk> myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen .
No man <unk> to sleep two in a bed .
In fact , you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother .
I don ’ t know how it is , but people like to be private when they are sleeping .
And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger , in a strange inn , in a strange town , and that stranger a harpooneer , then your <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed , more than anybody else ; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea , than <unk> Kings do ashore .
To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment , but you have your own hammock , and cover yourself with your own blanket , and sleep in your own skin .
The more I pondered over this harpooneer , the more I <unk> the thought of sleeping with him .
It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer , his linen or woollen , as the case might be , would not be of the <unk> , certainly none of the finest .
I began to <unk> all over .
Besides , it was getting late , and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going <unk> .
<unk> now , he should <unk> in upon me at midnight — how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming ?
“ Landlord !
I ’ ve changed my mind about that harpooneer . — I <unk> ’ t sleep with him .
I ’ ll try the bench here . ” “ Just as you please ; I ’ m sorry I can ’ t spare ye a <unk> for a <unk> , and it ’ s a <unk> rough board here ” — feeling of the <unk> and <unk> .
“ But wait a bit , <unk> ; I ’ ve got a carpenter ’ s plane there in the bar — wait , I say , and I ’ ll make ye snug enough . ” So saying he <unk> the plane ; and with his old <unk> handkerchief first <unk> the bench , vigorously set to <unk> away at my bed , the while grinning like an <unk> .
The shavings flew right and left ; till at last the <unk> came <unk> against an <unk> knot .
The landlord was near <unk> his wrist , and I told him for heaven ’ s sake to quit — the bed was soft enough to suit me , and I did not know how all the <unk> in the world could make <unk> down of a pine plank .
So <unk> up the shavings with another grin , and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room , he went about his business , and left me in a brown study .
I now took the measure of the bench , and found that it was a foot too short ; but that could be <unk> with a chair .
But it was a foot too narrow , and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the <unk> one — so there was no <unk> them .
I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall , leaving a little interval between , for my back to settle down in .
But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the <unk> of the window , that this plan would never do at all , especially as another <unk> from the <unk> door met the one from the window , and both together formed a series of small <unk> in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night .
The devil fetch that harpooneer , thought I , but stop , couldn ’ t I <unk> a march on him — bolt his door inside , and jump into his bed , not to be <unk> by the most violent <unk> ?
It seemed no bad idea ; but upon second thoughts I <unk> it .
For who could tell but what the next morning , so soon as I <unk> out of the room , the harpooneer might be standing in the entry , all ready to <unk> me down !
Still , looking round me again , and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person ’ s bed , I began to think that after all I might be <unk> <unk> <unk> against this unknown harpooneer .
Thinks I , I ’ ll wait awhile ; he must be dropping in before long .
I ’ ll have a good look at him then , and perhaps we may become jolly good <unk> after all — there ’ s no telling .
But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones , <unk> , and <unk> , and going to bed , yet no sign of my harpooneer .
“ Landlord ! ” said I , “ what sort of a chap is he — does he always keep such late hours ? ” It was now hard upon twelve o ’ clock .
The landlord <unk> again with his lean <unk> , and seemed to be <unk> <unk> at something beyond my <unk> .
“ No , ” he answered , “ generally he ’ s an early bird — <unk> to bed and <unk> to rise — yes , he ’ s the bird what <unk> the <unk> .
But to-night he went out a <unk> , you see , and I don ’ t see what on <unk> keeps him so late , unless , may be , he can ’ t sell his head . ” “ Can ’ t sell his head ? — What sort of a <unk> story is this you are telling me ? ” getting into a <unk> rage .
“ Do you pretend to say , landlord , that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday night , or rather Sunday morning , in <unk> his head around this town ? ” “ That ’ s precisely it , ” said the landlord , “ and I told him he couldn ’ t sell it here , the <unk> ’ s <unk> . ” “ With what ? ” shouted I.
“ With heads to be sure ; ain ’ t there too many heads in the world ? ” “ I tell you what it is , landlord , ” said I quite calmly , “ you ’ d better stop spinning that yarn to me — I ’ m not green . ” “ May be not , ” taking out a stick and <unk> a <unk> , “ but I <unk> guess you ’ ll be done _ brown _ if that ere harpooneer hears you a <unk> ’ his head . ” “ I ’ ll break it for him , ” said I , now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable <unk> of the landlord ’ s .
“ It ’ s broke a ’ ready , ” said he .
“ <unk> , ” said I — “ _ broke _ , do you mean ? ” “ <unk> , and that ’ s the very reason he can ’ t sell it , I guess . ” “ Landlord , ” said I , going up to him as cool as <unk> .
<unk> in a <unk> — “ landlord , stop <unk> .
You and I must understand one another , and that too without <unk> .
I come to your house and want a bed ; you tell me you can only give me half a one ; that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer .
And about this harpooneer , whom I have not yet seen , you <unk> in telling me the most <unk> and <unk> stories <unk> to beget in me an <unk> feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow — a sort of connexion , landlord , which is an <unk> and confidential one in the highest degree .
I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is , and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him .
And in the first place , you will be so good as to <unk> that story about <unk> his head , which if true I take to be good <unk> that this harpooneer is stark mad , and I ’ ve no idea of sleeping with a <unk> ; and you , sir , _ you _ I mean , landlord , _ you _ , sir , by trying to induce me to do so <unk> , would thereby render yourself <unk> to a <unk> <unk> . ” “ <unk> , ” said the landlord , fetching a long breath , “ that ’ s a <unk> long <unk> for a chap that <unk> a little now and then .
But be easy , be easy , this here harpooneer I have been <unk> ’ you of has just arrived from the south seas , where he <unk> up a lot of ’ <unk> New Zealand heads ( great <unk> , you know ) , and he ’ s <unk> all on ’ em but one , and that one he ’ s trying to sell to-night , cause to-morrow ’ s Sunday , and it would not do to be <unk> ’ human heads about the streets when <unk> is goin ’ to churches .
He wanted to , last Sunday , but I stopped him just as he was goin ’ out of the door with four heads <unk> on a string , for all the <unk> like a string of <unk> . ” This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery , and showed that the landlord , after all , had had no idea of <unk> me — but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath , engaged in such a cannibal business as <unk> the heads of dead <unk> ?
“ <unk> upon it , landlord , that harpooneer is a dangerous man . ” “ He <unk> <unk> ’ <unk> , ” was the <unk> .
“ But come , it ’ s getting dreadful late , you had better be turning flukes — it ’ s a <unk> bed ; <unk> and me slept in that ere bed the night we were <unk> .
There ’ s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed ; it ’ s an <unk> big bed that .
Why , afore we give it up , <unk> used to put our <unk> and little <unk> in the foot of it .
But I got a dreaming and <unk> about one night , and somehow , <unk> got pitched on the floor , and came near breaking his arm .
<unk> that , <unk> said it wouldn ’ t do .
Come along here , I ’ ll give ye a <unk> in a <unk> ; ” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me , offering to lead the way .
But I stood <unk> ; when looking at a clock in the corner , he exclaimed “ I <unk> it ’ s Sunday — you won ’ t see that harpooneer to-night ; he ’ s come to anchor somewhere — come along then ; _ do _ come ; _ won ’ t _ ye come ? ” I considered the matter a moment , and then up stairs we went , and I was <unk> into a small room , cold as a clam , and furnished , sure enough , with a prodigious bed , almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep <unk> .
“ There , ” said the landlord , placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a <unk> and centre table ; “ there , make yourself comfortable now , and good night to ye . ” I turned round from eyeing the bed , but he had disappeared .
<unk> back the counterpane , I stooped over the bed .
Though none of the most <unk> , it yet stood the <unk> <unk> well .
I then glanced round the room ; and besides the <unk> and centre table , could see no other furniture belonging to the place , but a rude shelf , the four walls , and a <unk> <unk> representing a man striking a whale .
Of things not properly belonging to the room , there was a hammock lashed up , and thrown upon the floor in one corner ; also a large seaman ’ s bag , containing the harpooneer ’ s <unk> , no doubt in lieu of a land trunk .
Likewise , there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the <unk> , and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed .
But what is this on the chest ?
I took it up , and held it close to the light , and felt it , and <unk> it , and tried every way possible to arrive at some <unk> conclusion concerning it .
I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat , <unk> at the <unk> with little <unk> <unk> something like the <unk> <unk> <unk> round an Indian <unk> .
There was a hole or <unk> in the middle of this mat , as you see the same in South American <unk> .
But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat , and <unk> the streets of any Christian town in that sort of <unk> ?
I put it on , to try it , and it <unk> me down like a <unk> , being uncommonly shaggy and thick , and I thought a little damp , as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a <unk> day .
I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall , and I never saw such a sight in my life .
I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a <unk> in the neck .
I sat down on the side of the bed , and commenced thinking about this <unk> harpooneer , and his door mat .
After thinking some time on the <unk> , I got up and took off my monkey jacket , and then stood in the middle of the room thinking .
I then took off my coat , and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves .
But beginning to feel very cold now , half <unk> as I was , and <unk> what the landlord said about the harpooneer ’ s not coming home at all that night , it being so very late , I made no more <unk> , but jumped out of my <unk> and boots , and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed , and <unk> myself to the care of heaven .
Whether that <unk> was stuffed with <unk> or broken <unk> , there is no telling , but I rolled about a good deal , and could not sleep for a long time .
At last I slid off into a light doze , and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of <unk> , when I heard a heavy <unk> in the passage , and saw a <unk> of light come into the room from under the door .
Lord save me , thinks I , that must be the harpooneer , the infernal <unk> .
But I lay perfectly still , and resolved not to say a word till spoken to .
<unk> a light in one hand , and that identical New Zealand head in the other , the stranger entered the room , and without looking towards the bed , placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner , and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room .
I was all eagerness to see his face , but he kept it <unk> for some time while employed in <unk> the bag ’ s mouth .
This accomplished , however , he turned round — when , good heavens !
what a sight !
Such a face !
It was of a dark , <unk> , yellow colour , here and there stuck over with large <unk> looking squares .
Yes , it ’ s just as I thought , he ’ s a terrible bedfellow ; he ’ s been in a fight , got <unk> cut , and here he is , just from the surgeon .
But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light , that I plainly saw they could not be <unk> at all , those black squares on his cheeks .
They were <unk> of some sort or other .
At first I knew not what to make of this ; but soon an <unk> of the truth occurred to me .
I remembered a story of a white man — a whaleman too — who , falling among the cannibals , had been tattooed by them .
I concluded that this harpooneer , in the course of his distant voyages , must have met with a similar adventure .
And what is it , thought I , after all !
It ’ s only his outside ; a man can be honest in any sort of skin .
But then , what to make of his unearthly complexion , that part of it , I mean , lying round about , and completely independent of the squares of tattooing .
To be sure , it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical <unk> ; but I never heard of a hot sun ’ s <unk> a white man into a <unk> yellow one .
However , I had never been in the South Seas ; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary <unk> upon the skin .
Now , while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning , this harpooneer never noticed me at all .
But , after some difficulty having opened his bag , he commenced <unk> in it , and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk , and a <unk> <unk> with the hair on .
<unk> these on the old chest in the middle of the room , he then took the New Zealand head — a ghastly thing enough — and <unk> it down into the bag .
He now took off his hat — a new beaver hat — when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise .
There was no hair on his head — none to speak of at least — nothing but a small <unk> twisted up on his forehead .
His <unk> <unk> head now looked for all the world like a <unk> skull .
Had not the stranger stood between me and the door , I would have bolted out of it <unk> than ever I bolted a dinner .
Even as it was , I thought something of slipping out of the window , but it was the second floor back .
I am no coward , but what to make of this <unk> purple rascal altogether passed my <unk> .
<unk> is the <unk> of fear , and being completely <unk> and confounded about the stranger , I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night .
In fact , I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him , and demand a <unk> answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him .
Meanwhile , he continued the business of <unk> , and at last showed his chest and arms .
As I live , these covered parts of him were <unk> with the same squares as his face ; his back , too , was all over the same dark squares ; he seemed to have been in a <unk> <unk> ’ <unk> , and just escaped from it with a <unk> shirt .
Still more , his very legs were marked , as if a parcel of dark green <unk> were running up the <unk> of young palms .
It was now quite plain that he must be some <unk> savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas , and so landed in this Christian country .
I <unk> to think of it .
A <unk> of heads too — perhaps the heads of his own <unk> .
He might take a fancy to mine — heavens !
look at that tomahawk !
But there was no time for shuddering , for now the savage went about something that completely <unk> my attention , and convinced me that he must indeed be a <unk> .
Going to his heavy <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , which he had previously hung on a chair , he <unk> in the pockets , and produced at length a curious little <unk> image with a <unk> on its back , and exactly the colour of a three days ’ old <unk> baby .
<unk> the embalmed head , at first I almost thought that this black <unk> was a real baby preserved in some similar manner .
But seeing that it was not at all limber , and that it <unk> a good deal like polished <unk> , I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol , which indeed it proved to be .
For now the savage goes up to the empty <unk> , and removing the <unk> <unk> , sets up this little <unk> image , like a <unk> , between the <unk> .
The chimney <unk> and all the <unk> inside were very <unk> , so that I thought this <unk> made a very <unk> little <unk> or chapel for his <unk> idol .
I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image , feeling but ill at ease <unk> — to see what was next to follow .
First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his <unk> pocket , and places them carefully before the idol ; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and <unk> the flame from the lamp , he <unk> the shavings into a <unk> <unk> .
Presently , after many <unk> <unk> into the fire , and still <unk> <unk> of his fingers ( whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly ) , he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit ; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little , he made a polite offer of it to the little negro .
But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all ; he never moved his lips .
All these strange <unk> were accompanied by still stranger <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , who seemed to be <unk> in a <unk> or else singing some pagan <unk> or other , during which his face <unk> about in the most unnatural manner .
At last <unk> the fire , he took the idol up very <unk> , and <unk> it again in his <unk> pocket as <unk> as if he were a <unk> <unk> a dead <unk> .
All these queer proceedings increased my <unk> , and seeing him now <unk> strong symptoms of concluding his business <unk> , and <unk> into bed with me , I thought it was high time , now or never , before the light was put out , to break the spell in which I had so long been bound .
But the interval I spent in <unk> what to say , was a fatal one .
<unk> up his tomahawk from the table , he <unk> the head of it for an instant , and then holding it to the light , with his mouth at the handle , he <unk> out great clouds of tobacco smoke .
The next moment the light was <unk> , and this wild cannibal , tomahawk between his teeth , sprang into bed with me .
I <unk> out , I could not help it now ; and giving a sudden <unk> of astonishment he began feeling me .
<unk> out something , I knew not what , I rolled away from him against the wall , and then <unk> him , whoever or whatever he might be , to keep quiet , and let me get up and light the lamp again .
But his <unk> <unk> satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning .
“ <unk> <unk> you ? ” — he at last said — “ you no <unk> , <unk> , I kill-e . ” And so saying the lighted tomahawk began <unk> about me in the dark .
“ Landlord , for God ’ s sake , Peter Coffin ! ” shouted I.
“ Landlord !
Watch !
Coffin !
<unk> !
save me ! ” “ <unk> !
<unk> me <unk> be , or <unk> , I kill-e ! ” again <unk> the cannibal , while his horrid <unk> of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire .
But thank heaven , at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand , and leaping from the bed I ran up to him .
“ Don ’ t be afraid now , ” said he , grinning again , “ Queequeg here wouldn ’ t harm a hair of your head . ” “ Stop your grinning , ” shouted I , “ and why didn ’ t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal ? ” “ I thought ye know ’ d it ; — didn ’ t I tell ye , he was a <unk> ’ heads around town ? — but turn flukes again and go to sleep .
Queequeg , look here — you sabbee me , I sabbee — you this man <unk> you — you sabbee ? ” “ <unk> sabbee plenty ” — <unk> Queequeg , puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed .
“ You <unk> in , ” he added , <unk> to me with his tomahawk , and throwing the clothes to one side .
He really did this in not only a <unk> but a really kind and charitable way .
I stood looking at him a moment .
For all his <unk> he was on the whole a clean , <unk> looking cannibal .
What ’ s all this <unk> I have been making about , thought I to myself — the man ’ s a human being just as I am : he has just as much reason to fear me , as I have to be afraid of him .
<unk> sleep with a sober cannibal than a <unk> Christian .
“ Landlord , ” said I , “ tell him to <unk> his tomahawk there , or pipe , or whatever you call it ; tell him to stop smoking , in short , and I will turn in with him .
But I don ’ t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me .
It ’ s dangerous .
Besides , I ain ’ t <unk> . ” This being told to Queequeg , he at once <unk> , and again politely <unk> me to get into bed — rolling over to one side as much as to say — “ I won ’ t touch a leg of ye . ” “ Good night , landlord , ” said I , “ you may go . ” I turned in , and never slept better in my life .
CHAPTER 4 .
The <unk> .
Upon waking next morning about daylight , I found Queequeg ’ s arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner .
You had almost thought I had been his wife .
The counterpane was of <unk> , full of odd little <unk> squares and <unk> ; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an <unk> <unk> <unk> of a figure , no two parts of which were of one precise shade — owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea <unk> in sun and shade , his shirt sleeves <unk> rolled up at various times — this same arm of his , I say , looked for all the world like a strip of that same <unk> <unk> .
Indeed , partly lying on it as the arm did when I first <unk> , I could hardly tell it from the <unk> , they so blended their <unk> together ; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was <unk> me .
My <unk> were strange .
Let me try to explain them .
When I was a child , I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me ; whether it was a reality or a dream , I never could entirely settle .
The circumstance was this .
I had been cutting up some <unk> or other — I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney , as I had seen a little sweep do a few days previous ; and my <unk> who , somehow or other , was all the time <unk> me , or sending me to bed <unk> , — my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed , though it was only two o ’ clock in the afternoon of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> day in the year in our <unk> .
I felt <unk> .
But there was no help for it , so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor , <unk> myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time , and with a bitter <unk> got between the sheets .
I lay there <unk> calculating that sixteen entire hours must <unk> before I could hope for a resurrection .
<unk> hours in bed !
the small of my back <unk> to think of it .
And it was so light too ; the sun <unk> in at the window , and a great rattling of <unk> in the streets , and the sound of gay voices all over the house .
I felt worse and worse — at last I got up , dressed , and softly going down in my <unk> feet , sought out my <unk> , and suddenly threw myself at her feet , <unk> her as a particular <unk> to give me a good <unk> for my <unk> ; anything indeed but <unk> me to lie <unk> such an <unk> length of time .
But she was the best and most conscientious of <unk> , and back I had to go to my room .
For several hours I lay there broad awake , feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since , even from the greatest subsequent <unk> .
At last I must have <unk> into a troubled <unk> of a doze ; and slowly waking from it — half <unk> in dreams — I opened my eyes , and the before <unk> room was now wrapped in outer darkness .
Instantly I felt a shock running through all my <unk> ; nothing was to be seen , and nothing was to be heard ; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine .
My arm hung over the counterpane , and the nameless , unimaginable , silent form or phantom , to which the hand belonged , seemed closely seated by my <unk> .
For what seemed ages piled on ages , I lay there , frozen with the most awful fears , not daring to drag away my hand ; yet ever thinking that if I could but <unk> it one single inch , the horrid spell would be broken .
I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me ; but waking in the morning , I <unk> remembered it all , and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in <unk> attempts to explain the mystery .
Nay , to this very hour , I often <unk> myself with it .
Now , take away the awful fear , and my <unk> at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar , in their <unk> , to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg ’ s pagan arm thrown round me .
But at length all the past night ’ s events <unk> <unk> , one by one , in fixed reality , and then I lay only alive to the comical <unk> .
For though I tried to move his arm — <unk> his <unk> <unk> — yet , sleeping as he was , he still <unk> me <unk> , as though naught but death should part us twain .
I now strove to <unk> him — “ Queequeg ! ” — but his only answer was a <unk> .
I then rolled over , my neck feeling as if it were in a <unk> ; and suddenly felt a slight <unk> .
<unk> aside the counterpane , there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage ’ s side , as if it were a <unk> baby .
A pretty pickle , truly , thought I ; <unk> here in a strange house in the broad day , with a cannibal and a tomahawk !
“ Queequeg ! — in the name of goodness , Queequeg , wake ! ” At length , by <unk> of much wriggling , and loud and incessant <unk> upon the <unk> of his <unk> a fellow male in that <unk> sort of style , I succeeded in <unk> a <unk> ; and presently , he drew back his arm , shook himself all over like a <unk> dog just from the water , and sat up in bed , stiff as a <unk> , looking at me , and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be there , though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly <unk> over him .
Meanwhile , I lay quietly eyeing him , having no serious <unk> now , and bent upon <unk> observing so curious a creature .
When , at last , his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow , and he became , as it were , <unk> to the fact ; he jumped out upon the floor , and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that , if it pleased me , he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards , leaving the whole apartment to myself .
Thinks I , Queequeg , under the circumstances , this is a very civilized <unk> ; but , the truth is , these savages have an <unk> sense of delicacy , say what you will ; it is marvellous how <unk> polite they are .
I pay this particular <unk> to Queequeg , because he treated me with so much <unk> and consideration , while I was guilty of great <unk> ; staring at him from the bed , and watching all his <unk> motions ; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my <unk> .
Nevertheless , a man like Queequeg you don ’ t see every day , he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding .
He commenced <unk> at top by <unk> his beaver hat , a very tall one , by the by , and then — still <unk> his trowsers — he hunted up his boots .
What under the heavens he did it for , I cannot tell , but his next movement was to crush himself — boots in hand , and hat on — under the bed ; when , from <unk> violent <unk> and <unk> , I inferred he was hard at work <unk> himself ; though by no law of <unk> that I ever heard of , is any man <unk> to be private when putting on his boots .
But Queequeg , do you see , was a creature in the transition stage — neither <unk> nor <unk> .
He was just enough civilized to show off his <unk> in the <unk> possible <unk> .
His <unk> was not yet completed .
He was an <unk> .
If he had not been a small degree civilized , he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all ; but then , if he had not been still a savage , he never would have <unk> of getting under the bed to put them on .
At last , he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes , and began <unk> and <unk> about the room , as if , not being much accustomed to boots , his pair of damp , wrinkled <unk> ones — probably not made to order either — rather <unk> and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning .
Seeing , now , that there were no <unk> to the window , and that the street being very narrow , the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room , and observing more and more the <unk> figure that Queequeg made , <unk> about with little else but his hat and boots on ; I begged him as well as I could , to <unk> his <unk> somewhat , and particularly to get into his <unk> as soon as possible .
He <unk> , and then proceeded to <unk> himself .
At that time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face ; but Queequeg , to my amazement , <unk> himself with <unk> his <unk> to his chest , arms , and hands .
He then <unk> his <unk> , and taking up a piece of hard <unk> on the <unk> centre table , <unk> it into water and commenced <unk> his face .
I was watching to see where he kept his <unk> , when lo and behold , he takes the harpoon from the bed corner , <unk> out the long wooden stock , <unk> the head , <unk> it a little on his <unk> , and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall , begins a vigorous scraping , or rather <unk> of his cheeks .
Thinks I , Queequeg , this is using <unk> ’ s best <unk> with a vengeance .
<unk> I <unk> the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made , and how exceedingly sharp the long straight <unk> are always kept .
The rest of his <unk> was soon achieved , and he <unk> <unk> out of the room , wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket , and sporting his harpoon like a <unk> ’ s <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> .
I quickly followed suit , and descending into the bar-room accosted the grinning landlord very <unk> .
I <unk> no malice towards him , though he had been <unk> with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow .
However , a good laugh is a mighty good thing , and rather too scarce a good thing ; the more ’ s the pity .
So , if any one man , in his own proper person , afford stuff for a good joke to anybody , let him not be backward , but let him <unk> allow himself to spend and be spent in that way .
And the man that has anything <unk> <unk> about him , be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for .
The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous , and whom I had not as yet had a good look at .
They were nearly all whalemen ; chief mates , and second mates , and third mates , and sea carpenters , and sea <unk> , and sea <unk> , and harpooneers , and ship <unk> ; a brown and brawny company , with <unk> <unk> ; an <unk> , shaggy set , all wearing monkey jackets for morning <unk> .
You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore .
This young fellow ’ s healthy cheek is like a <unk> <unk> in hue , and would seem to smell almost as <unk> ; he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian voyage .
That man next him looks a few shades lighter ; you might say a touch of <unk> wood is in him .
In the complexion of a third still <unk> a tropic <unk> , but slightly <unk> <unk> ; _ he _ doubtless has <unk> whole weeks ashore .
But who could show a cheek like Queequeg ?
which , <unk> with various <unk> , seemed like the Andes ’ western <unk> , to show forth in one array , contrasting <unk> , zone by zone .
“ <unk> , ho ! ” now cried the landlord , flinging open a door , and in we went to breakfast .
They say that men who have seen the world , thereby become quite at ease in manner , quite <unk> in company .
Not always , though : <unk> , the great New England traveller , and <unk> <unk> , the <unk> one ; of all men , they possessed the least <unk> in the parlor .
But perhaps the mere crossing of <unk> in a <unk> drawn by dogs as <unk> did , or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach , in the negro heart of Africa , which was the sum of poor <unk> ’ s performances — this kind of travel , I say , may not be the very best <unk> of attaining a high social <unk> .
Still , for the most part , that sort of thing is to be had anywhere .
These reflections just here are <unk> by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table , and I was <unk> to hear some good stories about whaling ; to my no small surprise , nearly every man maintained a profound silence .
And not only that , but they looked <unk> .
Yes , here were a set of <unk> , many of whom without the slightest <unk> had boarded great whales on the high seas — entire strangers to them — and <unk> them dead without <unk> ; and yet , here they sat at a social breakfast table — all of the same calling , all of kindred <unk> — looking round as <unk> at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some <unk> among the Green Mountains .
A curious sight ; these <unk> bears , these timid warrior whalemen !
But as for Queequeg — why , Queequeg sat there among them — at the head of the table , too , it so chanced ; as cool as an <unk> .
To be sure I cannot say much for his <unk> .
His greatest <unk> could not have <unk> <unk> his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him , and using it there without ceremony ; reaching over the table with it , to the imminent jeopardy of many heads , and <unk> the <unk> towards him .
But _ that _ was certainly very coolly done by him , and every one knows that in most people ’ s <unk> , to do anything coolly is to do it <unk> .
We will not speak of all Queequeg ’ s peculiarities here ; how he <unk> <unk> and hot rolls , and applied his <unk> attention to <unk> , done rare .
<unk> , that when breakfast was over he <unk> like the rest into the public room , lighted his <unk> , and was sitting there quietly <unk> and smoking with his <unk> hat on , when I sallied out for a stroll .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Street .
If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as Queequeg <unk> among the polite society of a civilized town , that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford .
In <unk> nigh the docks , any considerable <unk> will frequently offer to view the <unk> looking <unk> from foreign parts .
Even in <unk> and <unk> streets , Mediterranean mariners will sometimes <unk> the affrighted ladies .
<unk> Street is not unknown to <unk> and Malays ; and at <unk> , in the <unk> Green , live <unk> have often <unk> the <unk> .
But New Bedford <unk> all Water Street and <unk> .
In these <unk> <unk> you see only sailors ; but in New Bedford , <unk> cannibals stand <unk> at street corners ; savages <unk> ; many of whom yet carry on their bones <unk> flesh .
It makes a stranger <unk> .
But , besides the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and , besides the wild <unk> of the <unk> which <unk> reel about the streets , you will see other sights still more curious , certainly more comical .
There <unk> arrive in this town scores of green <unk> and New <unk> men , all <unk> for gain and glory in the fishery .
They are mostly young , of <unk> <unk> ; fellows who have <unk> forests , and now seek to drop the axe and <unk> the <unk> .
Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came .
In some things you would think them but a few hours old .
Look there !
that chap <unk> round the corner .
He wears a beaver hat and <unk> coat , <unk> with a <unk> and <unk> .
Here comes another with a <unk> ’ <unk> and a <unk> <unk> .
No <unk> <unk> will compare with a <unk> one — I mean a downright bumpkin <unk> — a fellow that , in the <unk> , will <unk> his two <unk> in <unk> <unk> for fear of <unk> his hands .
Now when a country <unk> like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation , and <unk> the great <unk> , you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the <unk> .
In <unk> his <unk> , he orders <unk> to his <unk> ; straps to his canvas trowsers .
Ah , poor <unk> !
how <unk> will burst those straps in the first howling gale , when thou art driven , straps , <unk> , and all , down the throat of the tempest .
But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers , cannibals , and <unk> to show her <unk> .
Not at all .
Still New Bedford is a queer place .
Had it not been for us whalemen , that <unk> of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of <unk> .
As it is , parts of her back country are enough to <unk> one , they look so bony .
The town itself is perhaps the <unk> place to live in , in all New England .
It is a land of oil , true enough : but not like <unk> ; a land , also , of <unk> and wine .
The streets do not run with milk ; nor in the <unk> do they <unk> them with fresh <unk> .
Yet , in spite of this , nowhere in all America will you find more <unk> houses ; <unk> and <unk> more <unk> , than in New Bedford .
<unk> came they ?
how planted upon this once <unk> <unk> of a country ?
Go and gaze upon the iron <unk> harpoons round yonder lofty <unk> , and your question will be answered .
Yes ; all these brave houses and <unk> <unk> came from the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian oceans .
One and all , they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea .
Can <unk> <unk> perform a feat like that ?
In New Bedford , fathers , they say , give whales for <unk> to their daughters , and portion off their <unk> with a few porpoises <unk> .
You must go to New Bedford to see a <unk> wedding ; for , they say , they have <unk> of oil in every house , and every night recklessly burn their <unk> in spermaceti candles .
In summer time , the town is sweet to see ; full of fine <unk> — long <unk> of green and gold .
And in August , high in air , the beautiful and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> their tapering upright <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
So omnipotent is art ; which in many a <unk> of New Bedford has <unk> bright <unk> of flowers upon the <unk> refuse rocks thrown aside at creation ’ s final day .
And the women of New Bedford , they bloom like their own red roses .
But roses only bloom in summer ; whereas the fine <unk> of their cheeks is <unk> as sunlight in the <unk> heavens .
<unk> match that bloom of theirs , ye cannot , save in <unk> , where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk , their sailor <unk> smell them miles off shore , as though they were drawing nigh the <unk> <unk> instead of the <unk> <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Chapel .
In this same New Bedford there stands a <unk> ’ s Chapel , and few are the moody fishermen , shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific , who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot .
I am sure that I did not .
<unk> from my first morning stroll , I again sallied out upon this special errand .
The sky had changed from clear , sunny cold , to driving sleet and mist .
<unk> myself in my shaggy jacket of the <unk> called <unk> , I fought my way against the stubborn storm .
<unk> , I found a small scattered congregation of sailors , and sailors ’ wives and widows .
A muffled silence reigned , only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm .
<unk> silent <unk> seemed <unk> sitting apart from the other , as if each silent grief were insular and <unk> .
The <unk> had not yet arrived ; and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets , with black <unk> , <unk> into the wall on either side the pulpit .
Three of them ran something like the following , but I do not pretend to <unk> : — <unk> TO THE <unk> OF <unk> <unk> , Who , at the age of eighteen , was lost overboard , <unk> the Isle of <unk> , off <unk> , _ <unk> _ 1 _ st _ , <unk> .
THIS <unk> Is erected to his <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> TO THE <unk> OF <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , AND <unk> <unk> , <unk> one of the boats ’ crews OF THE <unk> <unk> Who were towed out of sight by a Whale , On the <unk> Ground in the <unk> , _ December _ <unk> _ st _ , <unk> .
THIS <unk> Is here placed by their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> TO THE <unk> OF The late <unk> <unk> <unk> , Who in the bows of his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan , _ August _ 3 _ d _ , <unk> .
THIS <unk> Is erected to his <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> off the sleet from my <unk> hat and jacket , I seated myself near the door , and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me .
<unk> by the <unk> of the scene , there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance .
This savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance ; because he was the only one who could not read , and , therefore , was not reading those <unk> <unk> on the wall .
Whether any of the <unk> of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation , I knew not ; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery , and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the <unk> of some <unk> grief , that I feel sure that here before me were <unk> those , in whose <unk> hearts the sight of those <unk> tablets <unk> caused the old <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Oh !
ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass ; who standing among flowers can say — here , _ here _ lies my <unk> ; ye know not the <unk> that <unk> in <unk> like these .
What bitter <unk> in those <unk> <unk> which cover no ashes !
What despair in those <unk> <unk> !
What deadly <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the lines that seem to <unk> upon all Faith , and refuse <unk> to the beings who have <unk> perished without a grave .
As well might those tablets stand in the cave of <unk> as here .
In what census of living creatures , the dead of mankind are included ; why it is that a universal proverb says of them , that they tell no tales , though containing more secrets than the <unk> <unk> ; how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world , we <unk> so significant and infidel a word , and yet do not thus <unk> him , if he but <unk> for the remotest <unk> of this living earth ; why the Life <unk> <unk> pay <unk> upon <unk> ; in what eternal , <unk> <unk> , and deadly , hopeless trance , yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago ; how it is that we still refuse to be <unk> for those who we nevertheless maintain are <unk> in unspeakable <unk> ; why all the living so <unk> to <unk> all the dead ; wherefore but the <unk> of a knocking in a tomb will <unk> a whole city .
All these things are not without their meanings .
But Faith , like a <unk> , feeds among the <unk> , and even from these dead doubts she <unk> her most vital hope .
It needs scarcely to be told , with what feelings , on the eve of a Nantucket voyage , I regarded those marble tablets , and by the <unk> light of that <unk> , <unk> day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me .
Yes , Ishmael , the same fate may be thine .
But somehow I grew merry again .
<unk> <unk> to embark , fine chance for <unk> , it seems — aye , a stove boat will make me an immortal by <unk> .
Yes , there is death in this business of whaling — a <unk> quick <unk> <unk> of a man into <unk> .
But what then ?
Methinks we have <unk> mistaken this matter of Life and Death .
Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance .
Methinks that in looking at things spiritual , we are too much like <unk> observing the sun through the water , and thinking that thick water the <unk> of air .
Methinks my body is but the <unk> of my better being .
In fact take my body who will , take it I say , it is not me .
And therefore three cheers for Nantucket ; and come a stove boat and stove body when they will , for stave my soul , Jove himself cannot .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable <unk> entered ; immediately as the <unk> door flew back upon <unk> him , a quick <unk> eyeing of him by all the congregation , sufficiently <unk> that this fine old man was the <unk> .
Yes , it was the famous Father Mapple , so called by the whalemen , among whom he was a very great favourite .
He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth , but for many years past had <unk> his life to the <unk> .
At the time I now write of , Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age ; that sort of old age which seems <unk> into a second <unk> youth , for among all the <unk> of his wrinkles , there <unk> certain mild gleams of a newly <unk> bloom — the spring verdure <unk> forth even beneath <unk> ’ s snow .
No one having previously heard his history , could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest , because there were certain <unk> <unk> peculiarities about him , <unk> to that adventurous maritime life he had led .
When he entered I observed that he carried no <unk> , and certainly had not come in his <unk> , for his <unk> hat ran down with <unk> sleet , and his great pilot <unk> jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed .
However , hat and coat and <unk> were one by one removed , and hung up in a little space in an <unk> corner ; when , <unk> in a decent suit , he quietly <unk> the pulpit .
Like most old fashioned <unk> , it was a very lofty one , and since a regular stairs to such a height would , by its long angle with the floor , <unk> <unk> the already small area of the chapel , the <unk> , it seemed , had <unk> upon the hint of Father Mapple , and finished the pulpit without a stairs , <unk> a perpendicular side ladder , like those used in <unk> a ship from a boat at sea .
The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a <unk> pair of red <unk> <unk> for this ladder , which , being itself <unk> headed , and <unk> with a <unk> colour , the whole <unk> , considering what manner of chapel it was , seemed by no means in bad taste .
<unk> for an instant at the foot of the ladder , and with both hands grasping the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , Father Mapple cast a look upwards , and then with a truly <unk> but still <unk> <unk> , hand over hand , mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel .
The perpendicular parts of this side ladder , as is usually the case with swinging ones , were of <unk> rope , only the <unk> were of wood , so that at every step there was a <unk> .
At my first glimpse of the pulpit , it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship , these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary .
For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height , slowly turn round , and stooping over the pulpit , deliberately drag up the ladder step by step , till the whole was <unk> within , leaving him impregnable in his little <unk> .
I pondered some time without fully <unk> the reason for this .
Father Mapple <unk> such a wide reputation for <unk> and <unk> , that I could not <unk> him of <unk> <unk> by any mere <unk> of the stage .
No , thought I , there must be some sober reason for this thing ; <unk> , it must <unk> something unseen .
Can it be , then , that by that act of physical <unk> , he <unk> his spiritual <unk> for the time , from all outward <unk> <unk> and <unk> ?
Yes , for replenished with the meat and wine of the word , to the faithful man of God , this pulpit , I see , is a <unk> <unk> — a lofty <unk> , with a <unk> well of water within the walls .
But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place , <unk> from the <unk> ’ s former <unk> .
<unk> the marble <unk> on either hand of the pulpit , the wall which formed its back was <unk> with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers .
But high above the flying scud and <unk> clouds , there floated a little isle of sunlight , from which <unk> forth an angel ’ s face ; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of <unk> upon the ship ’ s tossed deck , something like that silver plate now inserted into the <unk> ’ s plank where <unk> fell .
“ Ah , noble ship , ” the angel seemed to say , “ beat on , beat on , thou noble ship , and bear a hardy helm ; for lo !
the sun is breaking through ; the clouds are rolling off — <unk> azure is at hand . ” Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same <unk> that had achieved the ladder and the picture .
<unk> <unk> front was in the likeness of a ship ’ s <unk> bows , and the Holy Bible <unk> on a projecting piece of <unk> work , fashioned after a ship ’ s <unk> <unk> .
What could be more full of meaning ? — for the pulpit is ever this earth ’ s foremost part ; all the rest comes in its rear ; the pulpit <unk> the world .
From thence it is the storm of God ’ s quick wrath is first descried , and the bow must bear the <unk> <unk> .
From thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first <unk> for <unk> winds .
Yes , the world ’ s a ship on its passage out , and not a voyage complete ; and the pulpit is its prow .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
Father Mapple rose , and in a mild voice of <unk> authority ordered the scattered people to <unk> .
“ <unk> gangway , there !
side away to larboard — larboard gangway to starboard !
<unk> !
<unk> ! ” There was a low <unk> of heavy <unk> among the <unk> , and a still <unk> <unk> of women ’ s shoes , and all was quiet again , and every eye on the preacher .
He paused a little ; then kneeling in the pulpit ’ s bows , folded his large brown hands across his chest , uplifted his closed eyes , and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and <unk> at the bottom of the sea .
This ended , in prolonged solemn tones , like the continual <unk> of a bell in a ship that is <unk> at sea in a <unk> — in such tones he commenced reading the following <unk> ; but <unk> his manner towards the concluding <unk> , burst forth with a <unk> <unk> and joy — “ The ribs and terrors in the whale , <unk> over me a dismal gloom , While all God ’ s <unk> waves rolled by , And lift me <unk> down to doom .
“ I saw the opening <unk> of hell , With endless pains and <unk> there ; Which none but they that feel can tell — Oh , I was plunging to despair .
“ In black <unk> , I called my God , When I could scarce believe him mine , He bowed his ear to my <unk> — No more the whale did me <unk> .
“ With speed he flew to my relief , As on a <unk> dolphin borne ; <unk> , yet bright , as lightning <unk> The face of my <unk> God .
“ My song for ever shall record That terrible , that <unk> hour ; I give the glory to my God , His all the mercy and the power . ” <unk> all joined in singing this <unk> , which swelled high above the howling of the storm .
A brief pause ensued ; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the Bible , and at last , <unk> his hand down upon the proper page , said : “ <unk> shipmates , <unk> the last <unk> of the first chapter of Jonah — ‘ And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah . ’ ” “ Shipmates , this book , containing only four chapters — four yarns — is one of the smallest <unk> in the mighty cable of the <unk> .
Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah ’ s deep <unk> sound !
what a <unk> lesson to us is this prophet !
What a noble thing is that <unk> in the fish ’ s belly !
How <unk> and <unk> grand !
We feel the <unk> <unk> over us ; we sound with him to the <unk> bottom of the waters ; <unk> and all the <unk> of the sea is about us !
But _ what _ is this lesson that the book of Jonah <unk> ?
Shipmates , it is a <unk> lesson ; a lesson to us all as <unk> men , and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God .
As <unk> men , it is a lesson to us all , because it is a story of the sin , <unk> , suddenly awakened fears , the swift <unk> , <unk> , prayers , and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah .
As with all sinners among men , the sin of this son of <unk> was in his wilful <unk> of the command of God — never mind now what that command was , or how conveyed — which he found a hard command .
But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do — remember that — and hence , he oftener <unk> us than endeavors to <unk> .
And if we obey God , we must <unk> ourselves ; and it is in this <unk> ourselves , wherein the <unk> of obeying God consists .
“ With this sin of <unk> in him , Jonah still further <unk> at God , by seeking to flee from Him .
He thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where God does not <unk> , but only the Captains of this earth .
He <unk> about the wharves of Joppa , and seeks a ship that ’ s bound for Tarshish .
There lurks , perhaps , a hitherto <unk> meaning here .
By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz .
That ’ s the opinion of learned men .
And where is Cadiz , shipmates ?
Cadiz is in Spain ; as far by water , from Joppa , as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days , when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea .
Because Joppa , the modern <unk> , shipmates , is on the most <unk> coast of the Mediterranean , the <unk> ; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the <unk> from that , just outside the Straits of <unk> .
See ye not then , shipmates , that Jonah sought to flee <unk> from God ?
<unk> man !
Oh !
most contemptible and worthy of all scorn ; with slouched hat and guilty eye , <unk> from his God ; <unk> among the shipping like a vile <unk> <unk> to cross the seas .
So disordered , <unk> is his look , that had there been <unk> in those days , Jonah , on the mere suspicion of something wrong , had been <unk> ere he touched a deck .
How plainly he ’ s a fugitive !
no <unk> , not a <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , — no friends <unk> him to the wharf with their <unk> .
At last , after much <unk> search , he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her <unk> ; and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin , all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the <unk> , to mark the stranger ’ s evil eye .
Jonah sees this ; but in vain he <unk> to look all ease and confidence ; in vain <unk> his wretched smile .
<unk> intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent .
In their gamesome but still serious way , one <unk> to the other — “ <unk> , he ’ s <unk> a widow ; ” or , “ <unk> , do you mark him ; he ’ s a <unk> ; ” or , “ <unk> lad , I guess he ’ s the <unk> that broke <unk> in old <unk> , or <unk> , one of the missing murderers from <unk> . ” Another runs to read the bill that ’ s stuck against the <unk> upon the wharf to which the ship is moored , offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a <unk> , and containing a description of his person .
He <unk> , and looks from Jonah to the bill ; while all his <unk> shipmates now crowd round Jonah , prepared to lay their hands upon him .
<unk> Jonah <unk> , and <unk> all his <unk> to his face , only looks so much the more a coward .
He will not confess himself suspected ; but that itself is strong suspicion .
So he makes the best of it ; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is <unk> , they let him pass , and he <unk> into the cabin .
“ ‘ Who ’ s there ? ’ cries the Captain at his busy desk , <unk> making out his papers for the <unk> — ‘ Who ’ s there ? ’ Oh !
how that harmless question <unk> Jonah !
For the instant he almost turns to flee again .
But he <unk> .
‘ I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish ; how soon sail ye , sir ? ’ Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah , though the man now stands before him ; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice , than he darts a <unk> glance .
‘ We sail with the next coming tide , ’ at last he slowly answered , still intently eyeing him .
‘ No sooner , sir ? ’ — ‘ Soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger . ’ Ha !
Jonah , that ’ s another <unk> .
But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that <unk> .
‘ I ’ ll sail with ye , ’ — he says , — ‘ the passage money how much is that ? — I ’ ll pay now . ’ For it is particularly written , shipmates , as if it were a thing not to be <unk> in this history , ‘ that he paid the fare <unk> ’ ere the craft did sail .
And taken with the <unk> , this is full of meaning .
“ Now Jonah ’ s Captain , shipmates , was one whose <unk> <unk> <unk> in any , but whose <unk> <unk> it only in the <unk> .
In this world , shipmates , sin that <unk> its way can travel freely , and without a <unk> ; whereas Virtue , if a <unk> , is stopped at all <unk> .
So Jonah ’ s Captain <unk> to test the length of Jonah ’ s purse , ere he judge him <unk> .
He <unk> him thrice the usual sum ; and it ’ s <unk> to .
Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive ; but at the same time <unk> to help a flight that <unk> its rear with gold .
Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse , prudent suspicions still <unk> the Captain .
He rings every coin to find a <unk> .
Not a <unk> , any way , he <unk> ; and Jonah is put down for his passage .
‘ <unk> out my <unk> , Sir , ’ says Jonah now , ‘ I ’ m <unk> ; I need sleep . ’ ‘ Thou <unk> like it , ’ says the Captain , ‘ there ’ s thy room . ’ Jonah enters , and would lock the door , but the lock contains no key .
<unk> him <unk> <unk> there , the Captain <unk> lowly to himself , and <unk> something about the doors of <unk> ’ <unk> being never allowed to be locked within .
All dressed and <unk> as he is , Jonah <unk> himself into his berth , and finds the little <unk> ceiling almost resting on his forehead .
The air is close , and Jonah <unk> .
Then , in that contracted hole , sunk , too , beneath the ship ’ s <unk> , Jonah feels the <unk> <unk> of that <unk> hour , when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels ’ <unk> .
“ <unk> at its axis against the side , a swinging lamp slightly <unk> in Jonah ’ s room ; and the ship , <unk> over towards the wharf with the weight of the last <unk> received , the lamp , flame and all , though in slight motion , still <unk> a permanent <unk> with reference to the room ; though , in truth , infallibly straight itself , it but made obvious the false , lying <unk> among which it hung .
The lamp <unk> and <unk> Jonah ; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place , and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his <unk> glance .
But that <unk> in the lamp more and more <unk> him .
The floor , the ceiling , and the side , are all <unk> .
‘ Oh !
so my conscience hangs in me ! ’ he <unk> , ‘ straight upwards , so it burns ; but the <unk> of my soul are all in <unk> ! ’ “ Like one who after a night of <unk> revelry <unk> to his bed , still reeling , but with conscience yet <unk> him , as the <unk> of the Roman <unk> but so much the more strike his steel <unk> into him ; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in <unk> anguish , <unk> God for <unk> until the fit be passed ; and at last amid the <unk> of woe he feels , a deep <unk> <unk> over him , as over the man who <unk> to death , for conscience is the wound , and there ’ s naught to <unk> it ; so , after <unk> <unk> in his berth , Jonah ’ s <unk> of ponderous <unk> drags him <unk> down to sleep .
“ And now the time of tide has come ; the ship <unk> off her cables ; and from the deserted wharf the <unk> ship for Tarshish , all <unk> , <unk> to sea .
That ship , my friends , was the first of recorded <unk> !
the <unk> was Jonah .
But the sea <unk> ; he will not bear the wicked burden .
A dreadful storm comes on , the ship is like to break .
But now when the <unk> calls all hands to <unk> her ; when boxes , <unk> , and <unk> are <unk> overboard ; when the wind is <unk> , and the men are <unk> , and every plank <unk> with <unk> feet right over Jonah ’ s head ; in all this raging <unk> , Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep .
He sees no black sky and raging sea , feels not the reeling timbers , and little hears he or <unk> he the far rush of the mighty whale , which even now with open mouth is <unk> the seas after him .
Aye , shipmates , Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship — a berth in the cabin as I have taken it , and was fast asleep .
But the frightened master comes to him , and shrieks in his dead ear , ‘ What meanest thou , O , sleeper !
<unk> ! ’ <unk> from his <unk> by that direful cry , Jonah <unk> to his feet , and <unk> to the deck , <unk> a shroud , to look out upon the sea .
But at that moment he is sprung upon by a <unk> billow leaping over the bulwarks .
<unk> after wave thus leaps into the ship , and finding no speedy <unk> runs roaring fore and aft , till the mariners come nigh to <unk> while yet afloat .
And ever , as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep <unk> in the blackness overhead , aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward , but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep .
“ <unk> upon terrors run shouting through his soul .
In all his <unk> attitudes , the <unk> is now too plainly known .
The sailors mark him ; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him , and at last , fully to test the truth , by <unk> the whole matter to high Heaven , they fall to casting <unk> , to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them .
The lot is Jonah ’ s ; that discovered , then how furiously they mob him with their questions .
‘ What is thine <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> thou ?
Thy country ?
What people ?
But mark now , my shipmates , the <unk> of poor Jonah .
The eager mariners but ask him who he is , and where from ; whereas , they not only receive an answer to those questions , but likewise another answer to a question not put by them , but the <unk> answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him .
“ ‘ I am a Hebrew , ’ he cries — and then — ‘ I fear the Lord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land ! ’ <unk> him , O Jonah ?
Aye , well <unk> thou fear the Lord God _ then ! _ <unk> , he now goes on to make a full <unk> ; <unk> the mariners became more and more <unk> , but still are <unk> .
For when Jonah , not yet <unk> God for mercy , since he but too well knew the darkness of his <unk> , — when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea , for he knew that for _ his _ sake this great tempest was upon them ; they <unk> turn from him , and seek by other means to save the ship .
But all in vain ; the <unk> gale <unk> <unk> ; then , with one hand raised <unk> to God , with the other they not <unk> lay hold of Jonah .
“ And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea ; when instantly an oily <unk> floats out from the east , and the sea is still , as Jonah carries down the gale with him , leaving smooth water behind .
He goes down in the whirling heart of such a <unk> commotion that he scarce <unk> the moment when he drops <unk> into the <unk> jaws awaiting him ; and the whale <unk> all his ivory teeth , like so many white bolts , upon his <unk> .
Then Jonah <unk> <unk> the Lord out of the fish ’ s belly .
But observe his prayer , and learn a <unk> lesson .
For <unk> as he is , Jonah does not <unk> and <unk> for direct deliverance .
He feels that his dreadful <unk> is just .
He leaves all his deliverance to God , <unk> himself with this , that spite of all his pains and <unk> , he will still look towards His holy <unk> .
And here , shipmates , is true and faithful <unk> ; not <unk> for <unk> , but <unk> for <unk> .
And how <unk> to God was this conduct in Jonah , is shown in the <unk> deliverance of him from the sea and the whale .
Shipmates , I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model for <unk> .
<unk> not ; but if you do , take heed to <unk> of it like Jonah . ” While he was speaking these words , the howling of the <unk> , <unk> storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher , who , when <unk> Jonah ’ s <unk> , seemed tossed by a storm himself .
His deep chest heaved as with a <unk> ; his tossed arms seemed the <unk> elements at work ; and the <unk> that rolled away from off his <unk> brow , and the light leaping from his eye , made all his simple <unk> look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them .
There now came a <unk> in his look , as he silently turned over the leaves of the Book once more ; and , at last , standing motionless , with closed eyes , for the moment , seemed <unk> with God and himself .
But again he leaned over towards the people , and bowing his head lowly , with an aspect of the deepest yet <unk> <unk> , he <unk> these words : “ Shipmates , God has laid but one hand upon you ; both his hands <unk> upon me .
I have read ye by what <unk> light may be mine the lesson that Jonah <unk> to all sinners ; and therefore to ye , and still more to me , for I am a greater <unk> than ye .
And now how gladly would I come down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit , and listen as you listen , while some one of you <unk> _ me _ that other and more awful lesson which Jonah <unk> to _ me _ , as a pilot of the living God .
How being an <unk> <unk> , or <unk> of true things , and <unk> by the Lord to sound those <unk> <unk> in the ears of a wicked Nineveh , Jonah , <unk> at the <unk> he should raise , fled from his mission , and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa .
But God is everywhere ; Tarshish he never reached .
As we have seen , God came upon him in the whale , and swallowed him down to living <unk> of doom , and with swift <unk> tore him along ‘ into the midst of the seas , ’ where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down , and ‘ the <unk> were wrapped about his head , ’ and all the watery world of woe <unk> over him .
Yet even then beyond the reach of any <unk> — ‘ out of the belly of hell ’ — when the whale <unk> upon the ocean ’ s utmost bones , even then , God heard the <unk> , <unk> prophet when he cried .
Then God <unk> <unk> the fish ; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea , the whale came <unk> up towards the warm and pleasant sun , and all the <unk> of air and earth ; and ‘ <unk> out Jonah upon the dry land ; ’ when the word of the Lord came a second time ; and Jonah , <unk> and <unk> — his ears , like two <unk> , still <unk> <unk> of the ocean — Jonah did the <unk> ’ s bidding .
And what was that , shipmates ?
To preach the Truth to the face of <unk> !
That was it !
“ This , shipmates , this is that other lesson ; and woe to that pilot of the living God who <unk> it .
Woe to him whom this world <unk> from <unk> duty !
Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has <unk> them into a gale !
Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to <unk> !
Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness !
Woe to him who , in this world , <unk> not <unk> !
Woe to him who would not be true , even though to be false were salvation !
Yea , woe to him who , as the great <unk> Paul has it , while <unk> to others is himself a <unk> ! ” He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment ; then lifting his face to them again , showed a deep joy in his eyes , as he cried out with a heavenly <unk> , — “ But oh !
shipmates !
on the starboard hand of every woe , there is a sure delight ; and higher the top of that delight , than the bottom of the woe is deep .
Is not the <unk> higher than the <unk> is low ?
Delight is to him — a far , far upward , and inward delight — who against the proud gods and <unk> of this earth , ever stands forth his own <unk> self .
Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him , when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him .
Delight is to him , who gives no quarter in the truth , and <unk> , burns , and <unk> all sin though he <unk> it out from under the robes of <unk> and <unk> .
Delight , — top-gallant delight is to him , who <unk> no law or lord , but the Lord his God , and is only a <unk> to heaven .
Delight is to him , whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the <unk> mob can never shake from this sure <unk> of the <unk> .
And eternal delight and <unk> will be his , who coming to lay him down , can say with his final breath — O Father ! — chiefly known to me by Thy rod — mortal or immortal , here I die .
I have <unk> to be <unk> , more than to be this world ’ s , or mine own .
Yet this is nothing : I leave <unk> to <unk> ; for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God ? ” He said no more , but slowly waving a <unk> , covered his face with his hands , and so remained kneeling , till all the people had departed , and he was left alone in the place .
CHAPTER <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel , I found Queequeg there quite alone ; he having left the Chapel before the <unk> some time .
He was sitting on a bench before the fire , with his feet on the stove hearth , and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his ; peering hard into its face , and with a jack-knife gently <unk> away at its nose , meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way .
But being now interrupted , he put up the image ; and pretty soon , going to the table , took up a large book there , and placing it on his <unk> began <unk> the pages with deliberate <unk> ; at every <unk> page — as I fancied — stopping a moment , looking <unk> around him , and giving <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> of astonishment .
He would then begin again at the next fifty ; seeming to <unk> at number one each time , as though he could not <unk> more than fifty , and it was only by such a large number of <unk> being found together , that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited .
With much interest I sat watching him .
<unk> though he was , and <unk> <unk> about the face — at least to my taste — his countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means <unk> .
You cannot hide the soul .
Through all his unearthly <unk> , I thought I saw the <unk> of a simple honest heart ; and in his large , deep eyes , fiery black and bold , there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils .
And besides all this , there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan , which even his <unk> could not altogether <unk> .
He looked like a man who had never <unk> and never had had a <unk> .
Whether it was , too , that his head being <unk> , his forehead was drawn out in <unk> and <unk> relief , and looked more <unk> than it otherwise would , this I will not venture to <unk> ; but certain it was his head was <unk> an excellent one .
It may seem ridiculous , but it reminded me of General Washington ’ s head , as seen in the popular <unk> of him .
It had the same long regularly <unk> <unk> <unk> from above the <unk> , which were likewise very projecting , like two long <unk> thickly <unk> on top .
Queequeg was George Washington <unk> <unk> .
<unk> I was thus closely <unk> him , <unk> meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the <unk> , he never heeded my presence , never troubled himself with so much as a single glance ; but appeared wholly occupied with <unk> the pages of the marvellous book .
<unk> how <unk> we had been sleeping together the night previous , and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning , I thought this indifference of his very strange .
But savages are strange beings ; at times you do not know exactly how to take them .
At first they are <unk> ; their calm <unk> of <unk> seems a <unk> wisdom .
I had noticed also that Queequeg never <unk> at all , or but very little , with the other seamen in the inn .
He made no advances whatever ; appeared to have no desire to <unk> the circle of his <unk> .
All this struck me as mighty singular ; yet , upon second thoughts , there was something almost sublime in it .
Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home , by the way of Cape Horn , that is — which was the only way he could get there — thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the <unk> Jupiter ; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease ; <unk> the utmost serenity ; content with his own <unk> ; always equal to himself .
Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy ; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that .
But , perhaps , to be true philosophers , we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving .
So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher , I conclude that , like the <unk> old woman , he must have “ broken his <unk> . ” As I sat there in that now lonely room ; the fire burning low , in that mild stage when , after its first intensity has <unk> the air , it then only <unk> to be looked at ; the evening shades and phantoms <unk> round the <unk> , and peering in upon us silent , solitary twain ; the storm <unk> without in solemn swells ; I began to be sensible of strange feelings .
I felt a <unk> in me .
No more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the <unk> world .
This <unk> savage had <unk> it .
There he sat , his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> he was ; a very sight of sights to see ; yet I began to feel myself <unk> drawn towards him .
And those same things that would have <unk> most others , they were the very <unk> that thus drew me .
I ’ ll try a pagan friend , thought I , since Christian <unk> has proved but hollow courtesy .
I drew my bench near him , and made some friendly signs and hints , doing my best to talk with him meanwhile .
At first he little noticed these advances ; but presently , upon my <unk> to his last night ’ s <unk> , he made out to ask me whether we were again to be <unk> .
I told him yes ; <unk> I thought he looked pleased , perhaps a little <unk> .
We then turned over the book together , and I <unk> to explain to him the purpose of the <unk> , and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it .
Thus I soon engaged his interest ; and from that we went to <unk> the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town .
Soon I <unk> a social smoke ; and , producing his <unk> and tomahawk , he quietly offered me a puff .
And then we sat <unk> puffs from that wild pipe of his , and keeping it regularly passing between us .
If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan ’ s breast , this pleasant , genial smoke we had , soon <unk> it out , and left us <unk> .
He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and <unk> as I to him ; and when our smoke was over , he pressed his forehead against mine , <unk> me round the waist , and said that <unk> we were <unk> ; meaning , in his country ’ s phrase , that we were bosom friends ; he would gladly die for me , if need should be .
In a <unk> , this sudden flame of <unk> would have seemed far too <unk> , a thing to be much distrusted ; but in this simple savage those old rules would not <unk> .
After supper , and another social chat and smoke , we went to our room together .
He made me a present of his embalmed head ; took out his enormous tobacco <unk> , and groping under the tobacco , drew out some thirty dollars in silver ; then <unk> them on the table , and mechanically dividing them into two equal <unk> , pushed one of them towards me , and said it was mine .
I was going to <unk> ; but he <unk> me by <unk> them into my trowsers ’ pockets .
I let them stay .
He then went about his evening prayers , took out his idol , and removed the paper <unk> .
By certain signs and symptoms , I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him ; but well knowing what was to follow , I <unk> a moment whether , in case he invited me , I would comply or otherwise .
I was a good Christian ; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible <unk> Church .
How then could I unite with this wild <unk> in worshipping his piece of wood ?
But what is worship ?
thought I.
Do you suppose now , Ishmael , that the <unk> God of heaven and earth — pagans and all included — can possibly be <unk> of an <unk> bit of black wood ?
<unk> !
But what is worship ? — to do the will of God — _ that _ is worship .
And what is the will of God ? — to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me — _ that _ is the will of God .
Now , Queequeg is my fellow man .
And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me ?
Why , unite with me in my particular <unk> form of worship .
<unk> , I must then unite with him in his ; <unk> , I must turn <unk> .
So I <unk> the shavings ; helped <unk> up the innocent little idol ; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg ; <unk> before him twice or thrice ; <unk> his nose ; and that done , we <unk> and went to bed , at peace with our own <unk> and all the world .
But we did not go to sleep without some little chat .
How it is I know not ; but there is no place like a bed for confidential <unk> between friends .
Man and wife , they say , there open the very bottom of their souls to each other ; and some old <unk> often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning .
Thus , then , in our hearts ’ <unk> , lay I and Queequeg — a cosy , loving pair .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> .
We had <unk> thus in bed , <unk> and <unk> at short intervals , and Queequeg now and then <unk> throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine , and then drawing them back ; so entirely sociable and free and easy were we ; when , at last , by reason of our <unk> , what little <unk> remained in us altogether departed , and we felt like getting up again , though <unk> was yet some way down the future .
Yes , we became very <unk> ; so much so that our <unk> position began to grow <unk> , and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up ; the clothes well <unk> around us , leaning against the <unk> with our four knees drawn up close together , and our two noses <unk> over them , as if our <unk> were <unk> .
We felt very <unk> and snug , the more so since it was so <unk> out of doors ; indeed out of <unk> too , seeing that there was no fire in the room .
The more so , I say , because truly to enjoy bodily <unk> , some small part of you must be cold , for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast .
Nothing exists in itself .
If you <unk> yourself that you are all over comfortable , and have been so a long time , then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more .
But if , like Queequeg and me in the bed , the <unk> of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly <unk> , why then , indeed , in the general consciousness you feel most <unk> and <unk> warm .
For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire , which is one of the <unk> <unk> of the rich .
For the height of this sort of <unk> is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your <unk> and the cold of the outer air .
Then there you lie like the one warm <unk> in the heart of an <unk> crystal .
We had been sitting in this <unk> manner for some time , when all at once I thought I would open my eyes ; for when between sheets , whether by day or by night , and whether asleep or awake , I have a way of always keeping my eyes shut , in order the more to <unk> the <unk> of being in bed .
Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed ; as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our <unk> , though light be more congenial to our <unk> part .
Upon opening my eyes then , and coming out of my own pleasant and <unk> darkness into the <unk> and <unk> outer gloom of the <unk> <unk> ’ <unk> , I experienced a <unk> <unk> .
Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light , seeing that we were so wide awake ; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his <unk> .
Be it said , that though I had felt such a strong <unk> to his smoking in the bed the night before , yet see how elastic our stiff <unk> grow when love once comes to bend them .
For now I <unk> nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me , even in bed , because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then .
I no more felt <unk> concerned for the landlord ’ s policy of <unk> .
I was only alive to the <unk> confidential <unk> of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend .
With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders , we now passed the <unk> from one to the other , till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging <unk> of smoke , <unk> by the flame of the <unk> lamp .
Whether it was that this <unk> <unk> rolled the savage away to far distant scenes , I know not , but he now spoke of his native island ; and , eager to hear his history , I begged him to go on and tell it .
He gladly <unk> .
Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his words , yet subsequent <unk> , when I had become more familiar with his broken <unk> , now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> .
Queequeg was a native of <unk> , an island far away to the West and South .
It is not down in any <unk> ; true places never are .
When a <unk> savage running wild about his native <unk> in a grass <unk> , followed by the <unk> <unk> , as if he were a green <unk> ; even then , in Queequeg ’ s <unk> soul , lurked a strong desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two .
His father was a High Chief , a King ; his <unk> a High Priest ; and on the maternal side he <unk> <unk> who were the wives of unconquerable <unk> .
There was excellent blood in his veins — royal stuff ; though sadly <unk> , I fear , by the cannibal <unk> he <unk> in his untutored youth .
A Sag Harbor ship visited his father ’ s bay , and Queequeg sought a passage to Christian lands .
But the ship , having her full <unk> of seamen , <unk> his suit ; and not all the King his father ’ s influence could <unk> .
But Queequeg <unk> a vow .
<unk> in his canoe , he <unk> off to a distant <unk> , which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island .
On one side was a coral <unk> ; on the other a low tongue of land , covered with <unk> <unk> that grew out into the water .
<unk> his canoe , still afloat , among these <unk> , with its prow <unk> , he sat down in the stern , <unk> low in hand ; and when the ship was gliding by , like a flash he darted out ; gained her side ; with one backward dash of his foot <unk> and sank his canoe ; <unk> up the chains ; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck , <unk> a <unk> there , and swore not to let it go , though <unk> in pieces .
In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard ; suspended a <unk> over his naked wrists ; Queequeg was the son of a King , and Queequeg <unk> not .
<unk> by his desperate <unk> , and his wild desire to visit Christendom , the captain at last <unk> , and told him he might make himself at home .
But this fine young savage — this sea <unk> of <unk> , never saw the Captain ’ s cabin .
They put him down among the sailors , and made a whaleman of him .
But like Czar Peter content to toil in the <unk> of foreign <unk> , Queequeg <unk> no seeming <unk> , if thereby he might happily gain the power of <unk> his untutored <unk> .
For at bottom — so he told me — he was <unk> by a profound desire to learn among the Christians , the <unk> whereby to make his people still <unk> than they were ; and more than that , still better than they were .
But , alas !
the <unk> of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked ; infinitely more so , than all his father ’ s <unk> .
<unk> at last in old Sag Harbor ; and seeing what the sailors did there ; and then going on to Nantucket , and seeing how they spent their <unk> in _ that _ place also , poor Queequeg gave it up for lost .
<unk> he , it ’ s a wicked world in all meridians ; I ’ ll die a pagan .
And thus an old <unk> at heart , he yet lived among these Christians , wore their clothes , and tried to talk their <unk> .
Hence the queer ways about him , though now some time from home .
By hints , I asked him whether he did not propose going back , and having a coronation ; since he might now consider his father dead and gone , he being very old and <unk> at the last accounts .
He answered no , not yet ; and added that he was fearful <unk> , or rather Christians , had <unk> him for ascending the pure and <unk> throne of thirty pagan Kings before him .
But by and by , he said , he would return , — as soon as he felt himself <unk> again .
For the <unk> , however , he <unk> to sail about , and <unk> his wild <unk> in all four oceans .
They had made a harpooneer of him , and that barbed iron was in lieu of a <unk> now .
I asked him what might be his immediate purpose , touching his future <unk> .
He answered , to go to sea again , in his old vocation .
Upon this , I told him that whaling was my own design , and informed him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket , as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from .
He at once resolved to <unk> me to that island , ship aboard the same vessel , get into the same watch , the same boat , the same <unk> with me , in short to share my every <unk> ; with both my hands in his , boldly dip into the <unk> of both worlds .
To all this I <unk> <unk> ; for besides the <unk> I now felt for Queequeg , he was an experienced harpooneer , and as such , could not fail to be of great <unk> to one , who , like me , was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling , though well acquainted with the sea , as known to merchant seamen .
His story being ended with his pipe ’ s last dying puff , Queequeg embraced me , pressed his forehead against mine , and blowing out the light , we rolled over from each other , this way and that , and very soon were sleeping .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> .
Next morning , <unk> , after <unk> of the embalmed head to a <unk> , for a block , I settled my own and comrade ’ s bill ; using , however , my comrade ’ s money .
The grinning landlord , as well as the boarders , seemed <unk> <unk> at the sudden <unk> which had sprung up between me and Queequeg — especially as Peter Coffin ’ s cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom I now <unk> with .
We <unk> a <unk> , and <unk> our things , including my own poor <unk> , and Queequeg ’ s canvas <unk> and hammock , away we went down to “ the Moss , ” the little Nantucket <unk> schooner moored at the wharf .
As we were going along the people <unk> ; not at Queequeg so much — for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets , — but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms .
But we heeded them not , going along wheeling the barrow by turns , and Queequeg now and then stopping to <unk> the <unk> on his harpoon barbs .
I asked him why he carried such a <unk> thing with him ashore , and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons .
To this , in substance , he replied , that though what I hinted was true enough , yet he had a particular <unk> for his own harpoon , because it was of assured stuff , well tried in many a mortal <unk> , and deeply <unk> with the hearts of whales .
In short , like many inland <unk> and mowers , who go into the <unk> ’ <unk> armed with their own <unk> — though in no wise obliged to furnish them — even so , Queequeg , for his own private reasons , <unk> his own harpoon .
<unk> the barrow from my hand to his , he told me a funny story about the first <unk> he had ever seen .
It was in Sag Harbor .
The owners of his ship , it seems , had <unk> him one , in which to carry his heavy chest to his <unk> house .
Not to seem ignorant about the thing — though in truth he was entirely so , concerning the precise way in which to <unk> the barrow — Queequeg <unk> his chest upon it ; <unk> it fast ; and then shoulders the barrow and <unk> up the wharf .
“ Why , ” said I , “ Queequeg , you might have known better than that , one would think .
Didn ’ t the people laugh ? ” Upon this , he told me another story .
The people of his island of <unk> , it seems , at their wedding <unk> express the fragrant water of young <unk> into a large <unk> <unk> like a punchbowl ; and this punchbowl always forms the great central <unk> on the <unk> mat where the feast is held .
Now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at <unk> , and its commander — from all accounts , a very stately <unk> gentleman , at least for a sea captain — this commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg ’ s sister , a pretty young <unk> just turned of ten .
Well ; when all the wedding guests were <unk> at the bride ’ s <unk> <unk> , this Captain <unk> in , and being <unk> the post of honor , placed himself over against the punchbowl , and between the High Priest and his majesty the King , Queequeg ’ s father .
Grace being said , — for those people have their grace as well as we — though Queequeg told me that unlike us , who at such times look downwards to our <unk> , they , on the contrary , copying the <unk> , glance upwards to the great <unk> of all <unk> — Grace , I say , being said , the High Priest <unk> the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island ; that is , <unk> his <unk> and <unk> fingers into the bowl before the blessed <unk> <unk> .
Seeing himself placed next the Priest , and <unk> the ceremony , and thinking himself — being Captain of a ship — as having plain <unk> over a mere island King , especially in the King ’ s own house — the Captain coolly proceeds to <unk> his hands in the punchbowl ; — taking it I suppose for a huge <unk> .
“ Now , ” said Queequeg , “ what you <unk> now ? — Didn ’ t our people laugh ? ” At last , passage paid , and <unk> safe , we stood on board the schooner .
<unk> sail , it glided down the <unk> river .
On one side , New Bedford rose in <unk> of streets , their <unk> trees all glittering in the clear , cold air .
<unk> hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves , and side by side the <unk> whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last ; while from others came a sound of carpenters and <unk> , with blended <unk> of fires and <unk> to <unk> the pitch , all <unk> that new <unk> were on the start ; that one most perilous and long voyage ended , only begins a second ; and a second ended , only begins a third , and so on , for ever and for aye .
Such is the <unk> , yea , the <unk> of all earthly effort .
<unk> the more open water , the bracing breeze <unk> fresh ; the little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows , as a young colt his <unk> .
How I snuffed that Tartar air ! — how I <unk> that <unk> earth ! — that common <unk> all over dented with the marks of <unk> <unk> and <unk> ; and turned me to <unk> the <unk> of the sea which will <unk> no <unk> .
At the same <unk> , Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me .
His dusky nostrils swelled apart ; he showed his <unk> and pointed teeth .
On , on we flew ; and our offing gained , the Moss did homage to the blast ; <unk> and dived her bows as a slave before the <unk> .
<unk> leaning , we sideways darted ; every <unk> <unk> like a <unk> ; the two tall masts <unk> like Indian <unk> in land <unk> .
So full of this reeling scene were we , as we stood by the plunging bowsprit , that for some time we did not notice the <unk> glances of the passengers , a <unk> <unk> , who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so <unk> ; as though a white man were anything more <unk> than a <unk> negro .
But there were some <unk> and <unk> there , who , by their intense <unk> , must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure .
Queequeg caught one of these young <unk> <unk> him behind his back .
I thought the bumpkin ’ s hour of doom was come .
<unk> his harpoon , the brawny savage caught him in his arms , and by an almost miraculous <unk> and strength , sent him high up bodily into the air ; then slightly <unk> his stern in <unk> , the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet , while Queequeg , turning his back upon him , lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff .
“ Capting !
Capting ! ” yelled the bumpkin , running towards that officer ; “ Capting , Capting , here ’ s the devil . ” “ <unk> , _ you _ sir , ” cried the Captain , a gaunt rib of the sea , <unk> up to Queequeg , “ what in thunder do you mean by that ?
Don ’ t you know you might have killed that chap ? ” “ What him say ? ” said Queequeg , as he mildly turned to me .
“ He say , ” said I , “ that you came near kill-e that man there , ” pointing to the still shivering <unk> .
“ <unk> , ” cried Queequeg , twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of <unk> , “ ah !
him <unk> <unk> <unk> ; Queequeg no kill-e so <unk> <unk> ; Queequeg kill-e big whale ! ” “ Look you , ” roared the Captain , “ I ’ ll kill-e _ you _ , you cannibal , if you try any more of your <unk> aboard here ; so mind your eye . ” But it so happened just then , that it was high time for the Captain to mind his own eye .
The prodigious strain upon the <unk> had parted the <unk> , and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side , completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck .
The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so <unk> , was swept overboard ; all hands were in a panic ; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it , seemed madness .
It flew from right to left , and back again , almost in one <unk> of a watch , and every instant seemed on the point of <unk> into splinters .
Nothing was done , and nothing seemed capable of being done ; those on deck rushed towards the bows , and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale .
In the midst of this consternation , Queequeg dropped <unk> to his knees , and crawling under the path of the boom , <unk> hold of a rope , secured one end to the bulwarks , and then flinging the other like a <unk> , caught it round the boom as it swept over his head , and at the next <unk> , the spar was that way <unk> , and all was safe .
The schooner was run into the wind , and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat , Queequeg , stripped to the waist , darted from the side with a long living <unk> of a leap .
For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog , throwing his long arms straight out before him , and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the <unk> foam .
I looked at the grand and glorious fellow , but saw no one to be saved .
The <unk> had gone down .
<unk> himself perpendicularly from the water , Queequeg , now took an instant ’ s glance around him , and seeming to see just how matters were , dived down and disappeared .
A few minutes more , and he rose again , one arm still striking out , and with the other dragging a lifeless form .
The boat soon picked them up .
The poor bumpkin was <unk> .
All hands <unk> Queequeg a noble <unk> ; the captain begged his <unk> .
From that hour I <unk> to Queequeg like a <unk> ; yea , till poor Queequeg took his last long dive .
Was there ever such <unk> ?
He did not seem to think that he at all <unk> a <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
He only asked for water — fresh water — something to <unk> the brine off ; that done , he put on dry clothes , lighted his pipe , and leaning against the bulwarks , and mildly eyeing those around him , seemed to be saying to himself — “ It ’ s a mutual , <unk> world , in all meridians .
We cannibals must help these Christians . ” CHAPTER <unk> .
Nantucket .
Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the <unk> ; so , after a fine run , we safely arrived in Nantucket .
Nantucket !
Take out your <unk> and look at it .
See what a real corner of the world it <unk> ; how it stands there , away off shore , more lonely than the <unk> <unk> .
Look at it — a mere <unk> , and <unk> of sand ; all beach , without a <unk> .
There is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a <unk> for <unk> paper .
Some gamesome <unk> will tell you that they have to <unk> <unk> there , they don ’ t grow naturally ; that they <unk> <unk> <unk> ; that they have to send beyond seas for a <unk> to stop a leak in an oil cask ; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome ; that people there <unk> <unk> before their houses , to get under the shade in summer time ; that one blade of grass makes an <unk> , three blades in a day ’ s walk a prairie ; that they wear <unk> shoes , something like <unk> <unk> ; that they are so shut up , <unk> about , every way <unk> , surrounded , and made an utter island of by the ocean , that to their very <unk> and <unk> small <unk> will sometimes be found adhering , as to the backs of sea <unk> .
But these <unk> only show that Nantucket is no <unk> .
Look now at the wondrous <unk> story of how this island was settled by the <unk> .
Thus goes the <unk> .
In <unk> times an eagle <unk> down upon the New England coast , and carried off an <unk> Indian in his <unk> .
With loud <unk> the <unk> saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters .
They resolved to follow in the same direction .
<unk> out in their canoes , after a perilous passage they discovered the island , and there they found an empty ivory <unk> , — the poor little Indian ’ s skeleton .
What wonder , then , that these Nantucketers , born on a beach , should take to the sea for a <unk> !
They first caught <unk> and <unk> in the sand ; grown <unk> , they <unk> out with <unk> for <unk> ; more experienced , they pushed off in boats and captured cod ; and at last , <unk> a navy of great ships on the sea , <unk> this watery world ; put an incessant belt of <unk> round it ; <unk> in at <unk> ’ s Straits ; and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has <unk> the flood ; most monstrous and most <unk> !
That <unk> , <unk> <unk> , clothed with such <unk> of unconscious power , that his very <unk> are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults !
And thus have these naked Nantucketers , these sea <unk> , <unk> from their <unk> in the sea , <unk> and <unk> the watery world like so many <unk> ; <unk> out among them the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian oceans , as the three pirate powers did <unk> .
Let America add <unk> to <unk> , and pile <unk> upon <unk> ; let the English <unk> all India , and hang out their blazing <unk> from the sun ; two thirds of this <unk> globe are the Nantucketer ’ s .
For the sea is his ; he <unk> it , as Emperors own <unk> ; other seamen having but a right of way through it .
<unk> ships are but <unk> <unk> ; armed ones but floating <unk> ; even pirates and <unk> , though following the sea as <unk> the road , they but <unk> other ships , other <unk> of the land like themselves , without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself .
The Nantucketer , he alone <unk> and <unk> on the sea ; he alone , in Bible language , goes down to it in ships ; to and fro <unk> it as his own special <unk> .
_ There _ is his home ; _ there _ lies his business , which a Noah ’ s flood would not <unk> , though it <unk> all the millions in China .
He lives on the sea , as prairie <unk> in the prairie ; he <unk> among the waves , he <unk> them as <unk> hunters climb the <unk> .
For years he knows not the land ; so that when he comes to it at last , it smells like another world , more strangely than the moon would to an <unk> .
With the <unk> <unk> , that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows ; so at <unk> , the Nantucketer , out of sight of land , <unk> his sails , and lays him to his rest , while under his very pillow rush herds of <unk> and whales .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> .
It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor , and Queequeg and I went ashore ; so we could attend to no business that day , at least none but a supper and a bed .
The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had <unk> us to his <unk> Hosea Hussey of the <unk> <unk> , whom he <unk> to be the <unk> of one of the best kept <unk> in all Nantucket , and moreover he had assured us that <unk> Hosea , as he called him , was famous for his <unk> .
In short , he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow <unk> on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard , and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard , and that done , then ask the first man we met where the place was : these crooked directions of his very much <unk> us at first , especially as , at the <unk> , Queequeg insisted that the yellow <unk> — our first point of <unk> — must be left on the larboard hand , whereas I had <unk> Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard .
However , by <unk> of beating about a little in the dark , and now and then knocking up a peaceable <unk> to <unk> the way , we at last came to something which there was no <unk> .
Two enormous wooden pots painted black , and suspended by <unk> ’ ears , swung from the cross-trees of an old <unk> , planted in front of an old <unk> .
The horns of the cross-trees were <unk> off on the other side , so that this old <unk> looked not a little like a gallows .
Perhaps I was over <unk> to such impressions at the time , but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague <unk> .
A sort of <unk> was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns ; yes , _ two _ of them , one for Queequeg , and one for me .
It ’ s <unk> , thinks I.
A Coffin my <unk> upon <unk> in my first whaling port ; <unk> staring at me in the whalemen ’ s chapel ; and here a gallows !
and a pair of prodigious black pots too !
Are these last throwing out <unk> hints touching <unk> ?
I was called from these reflections by the sight of a <unk> woman with yellow hair and a yellow <unk> , standing in the <unk> of the inn , under a dull red lamp swinging there , that looked much like an <unk> eye , and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt .
“ <unk> along with ye , ” said she to the man , “ or I ’ ll be <unk> ye ! ” “ Come on , Queequeg , ” said I , “ all right .
There ’ s Mrs. Hussey . ” And so it turned out ; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home , but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs .
Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed , Mrs. Hussey , <unk> further scolding for the present , <unk> us into a little room , and <unk> us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded <unk> , turned round to us and said — “ <unk> or Cod ? ” “ What ’ s that about <unk> , <unk> ’ am ? ” said I , with much <unk> .
“ <unk> or Cod ? ” she repeated .
“ A clam for supper ?
a cold clam ; is _ that _ what you mean , Mrs. Hussey ? ” says I , “ but that ’ s a rather cold and <unk> <unk> in the winter time , ain ’ t it , Mrs. Hussey ? ” But being in a great hurry to <unk> scolding the man in the purple <unk> , who was <unk> for it in the entry , and seeming to hear nothing but the word “ clam , ” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen , and <unk> out “ clam for two , ” disappeared .
“ Queequeg , ” said I , “ do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam ? ” However , a warm <unk> steam from the kitchen served to <unk> the apparently <unk> prospect before us .
But when that smoking chowder came in , the mystery was <unk> explained .
Oh , sweet friends !
<unk> to me .
It was made of small <unk> <unk> , scarcely <unk> than <unk> <unk> , mixed with <unk> ship biscuit , and salted <unk> cut up into little <unk> ; the whole <unk> with butter , and <unk> <unk> with <unk> and salt .
Our <unk> being <unk> by the frosty voyage , and in particular , Queequeg seeing his favourite <unk> food before him , and the chowder being <unk> excellent , we <unk> it with great <unk> : when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey ’ s clam and cod announcement , I thought I would try a little experiment .
<unk> to the kitchen door , I <unk> the word “ cod ” with great <unk> , and resumed my seat .
In a few moments the <unk> steam came forth again , but with a different flavor , and in good time a fine <unk> was placed before us .
We resumed business ; and while <unk> our <unk> in the bowl , thinks I to myself , I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head ?
What ’ s that <unk> saying about <unk> people ?
“ But look , Queequeg , ain ’ t that a live <unk> in your bowl ?
Where ’ s your harpoon ? ” <unk> of all fishy places was the <unk> <unk> , which well <unk> its name ; for the pots there were always boiling <unk> .
<unk> for breakfast , and chowder for dinner , and chowder for supper , till you began to look for <unk> coming through your clothes .
The area before the house was <unk> with <unk> .
Mrs. Hussey wore a polished <unk> of <unk> <unk> ; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old <unk> .
There was a fishy flavor to the milk , too , which I could not at all account for , till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen ’ s boats , I saw Hosea ’ s <unk> <unk> feeding on fish <unk> , and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod ’ s <unk> head , looking very <unk> , I assure ye .
Supper concluded , we received a lamp , and directions from Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed ; but , as Queequeg was about to <unk> me up the stairs , the lady reached forth her arm , and demanded his harpoon ; she allowed no harpoon in her <unk> .
“ Why not ? ” said I ; “ every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon — but why not ? ” “ Because it ’ s dangerous , ” says she .
“ <unk> since young <unk> coming from that <unk> ’ <unk> <unk> ’ <unk> ’ <unk> of his , when he was gone four years and a half , with only three barrels of _ <unk> _ , was found dead in my first floor back , with his harpoon in his side ; ever since then I allow no boarders to take <unk> dangerous <unk> in their <unk> at night .
So , Mr. Queequeg ” ( for she had learned his name ) , “ I will just take this here iron , and keep it for you till morning .
But the chowder ; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast , men ? ” “ Both , ” says I ; “ and let ’ s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety . ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The Ship .
In bed we <unk> our <unk> for the <unk> .
But to my surprise and no small concern , Queequeg now gave me to understand , that he had been diligently <unk> Yojo — the name of his black little god — and Yojo had told him two or three times over , and strongly insisted upon it <unk> , that instead of our going together among the <unk> in harbor , and in <unk> <unk> our craft ; instead of this , I say , Yojo earnestly <unk> that the <unk> of the ship should rest wholly with me , inasmuch as Yojo <unk> <unk> us ; and , in order to do so , had already pitched upon a vessel , which , if left to myself , I , Ishmael , should infallibly light upon , for all the world as though it had turned out by chance ; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself , for the present <unk> of Queequeg .
I have forgotten to mention that , in many things , Queequeg placed great confidence in the <unk> of Yojo ’ s judgment and surprising <unk> of things ; and <unk> Yojo with considerable <unk> , as a rather good sort of god , who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole , but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent <unk> .
Now , this plan of Queequeg ’ s , or rather Yojo ’ s , touching the <unk> of our craft ; I did not like that plan at all .
I had not a little <unk> upon Queequeg ’ s <unk> to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our <unk> <unk> .
But as all my <unk> produced no effect upon Queequeg , I was obliged to <unk> ; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and <unk> , that should quickly settle that <unk> little affair .
Next morning early , leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little <unk> — for it seemed that it was some sort of <unk> or Ramadan , or day of <unk> , <unk> , and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day ; _ how _ it was I never could find out , for , though I applied myself to it several times , I never could master his <unk> and <unk> <unk> — leaving Queequeg , then , <unk> on his tomahawk pipe , and Yojo <unk> himself at his <unk> fire of shavings , I sallied out among the shipping .
After much prolonged sauntering and many random <unk> , I <unk> that there were three ships up for <unk> ’ voyages — The <unk> , the <unk> , and the Pequod .
_ <unk> _ , I do not know the <unk> of ; _ <unk> _ is obvious ; _ Pequod _ , you will no doubt remember , was the name of a <unk> tribe of <unk> Indians ; now <unk> as the ancient <unk> .
I peered and <unk> about the <unk> ; from her , <unk> over to the <unk> ; and finally , going on board the Pequod , looked around her for a moment , and then decided that this was the very ship for us .
You may have seen many a <unk> craft in your day , for aught I know ; — <unk> <unk> ; <unk> Japanese <unk> ; <unk> <unk> , and what not ; but take my word for it , you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod .
She was a ship of the old school , rather small if anything ; with an old-fashioned <unk> look about her .
Long <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> of all four oceans , her old hull ’ s complexion was <unk> like a French <unk> ’ s , who has alike fought in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> venerable bows looked <unk> .
<unk> masts — cut somewhere on the coast of Japan , where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale — her masts stood stiffly up like the <unk> of the three old kings of <unk> .
<unk> ancient decks were worn and wrinkled , like the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> where <unk> <unk> .
But to all these her old <unk> , were added new and marvellous features , pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed .
Old Captain Peleg , many years her chief-mate , before he commanded another vessel of his own , and now a retired seaman , and one of the principal owners of the Pequod , — this old Peleg , during the term of his <unk> , had built upon her original <unk> , and <unk> it , all over , with a <unk> both of material and <unk> , <unk> by anything except it be <unk> ’ s carved <unk> or <unk> .
She was <unk> like any barbaric <unk> <unk> , his neck heavy with <unk> of polished ivory .
She was a thing of <unk> .
A cannibal of a craft , <unk> herself forth in the chased bones of her <unk> .
All round , her <unk> , open bulwarks were <unk> like one continuous jaw , with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale , inserted there for <unk> , to fasten her old hempen <unk> and tendons to .
Those <unk> ran not through base blocks of land wood , but <unk> <unk> over <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> a <unk> wheel at her reverend helm , she <unk> there a tiller ; and that tiller was in one mass , curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe .
The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest , felt like the Tartar , when he holds back his fiery steed by <unk> its jaw .
A noble craft , but somehow a most melancholy !
All noble things are touched with that .
Now when I looked about the quarter-deck , for some one having authority , in order to propose myself as a <unk> for the voyage , at first I saw <unk> ; but I could not well <unk> a strange sort of tent , or rather wigwam , pitched a little behind the main-mast .
It seemed only a temporary <unk> used in port .
It was of a <unk> shape , some ten feet high ; <unk> of the long , huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the <unk> .
<unk> with their broad ends on the deck , a circle of these slabs <unk> together , <unk> <unk> towards each other , and at the <unk> united in a tufted point , where the loose <unk> fibres waved to and fro like the <unk> on some old <unk> <unk> ’ s head .
A triangular opening <unk> towards the bows of the ship , so that the <unk> commanded a complete view forward .
And half <unk> in this queer <unk> , I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority ; and who , it being noon , and the ship ’ s work suspended , was now <unk> <unk> from the burden of command .
He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair , wriggling all over with curious carving ; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout <unk> of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was <unk> .
There was nothing so very particular , perhaps , about the appearance of the <unk> man I saw ; he was brown and brawny , like most old seamen , and heavily rolled up in blue <unk> , cut in the Quaker style ; only there was a fine and almost <unk> <unk> of the <unk> wrinkles <unk> round his eyes , which must have <unk> from his continual <unk> in many hard <unk> , and always looking to windward ; — for this <unk> the muscles about the eyes to become <unk> together .
Such <unk> are very <unk> in a <unk> .
“ Is this the Captain of the Pequod ? ” said I , advancing to the door of the tent .
“ <unk> it be the captain of the Pequod , what dost thou want of him ? ” he demanded .
“ I was thinking of shipping . ” “ Thou <unk> , <unk> thou ?
I see thou art no Nantucketer — ever been in a stove boat ? ” “ No , Sir , I never have . ” “ Dost know nothing at all about whaling , I dare say — eh ?
“ Nothing , Sir ; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn .
I ’ ve been several voyages in the merchant service , and I think that — ” “ <unk> service be damned .
Talk not that <unk> to me .
Dost see that leg ? — I ’ ll take that leg away from thy stern , if ever thou <unk> of the marchant service to me again .
<unk> service indeed !
I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships .
But flukes !
man , what makes thee want to go a whaling , eh ? — it looks a little suspicious , don ’ t it , eh ? — Hast not been a pirate , hast thou ? — <unk> not <unk> thy last Captain , didst thou ? — Dost not think of <unk> the officers when thou <unk> to sea ? ” I <unk> my innocence of these things .
I saw that under the <unk> of these half humorous <unk> , this old seaman , as an <unk> <unk> Nantucketer , was full of his insular <unk> , and rather distrustful of all <unk> , unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard .
“ But what takes thee a-whaling ?
I want to know that before I think of shipping ye . ” “ Well , sir , I want to see what whaling is .
I want to see the world . ” “ <unk> to see what whaling is , eh ?
Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab ? ” “ Who is Captain Ahab , sir ? ” “ Aye , aye , I thought so .
Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship . ” “ I am mistaken then .
I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself . ” “ Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg — that ’ s who ye are speaking to , young man .
It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage , and supplied with all her needs , including crew .
We are part owners and <unk> .
But as I was going to say , if thou <unk> to know what whaling is , as thou <unk> ye do , I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye <unk> yourself to it , past backing out .
<unk> eye on Captain Ahab , young man , and thou wilt find that he has only one leg . ” “ What do you mean , sir ?
Was the other one lost by a whale ? ” “ <unk> by a whale !
Young man , come nearer to me : it was <unk> , chewed up , <unk> by the <unk> <unk> that ever <unk> a boat ! — ah , ah ! ” I was a little alarmed by his energy , perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation , but said as calmly as I could , “ What you say is no doubt true enough , sir ; but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale , though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident . ” “ Look ye now , young man , thy lungs are a sort of soft , d ’ ye see ; thou dost not talk shark a bit .
_ <unk> _ , ye ’ ve been to sea before now ; sure of that ? ” “ Sir , ” said I , “ I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant — ” “ <unk> down out of that !
<unk> what I said about the marchant service — don ’ t <unk> me — I won ’ t have it .
But let us understand each other .
I have given thee a hint about what whaling is ; do ye yet feel inclined for it ? ” “ I do , sir . ” “ Very good .
Now , art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale ’ s throat , and then jump after it ?
<unk> , quick ! ” “ I am , sir , if it should be <unk> indispensable to do so ; not to be got rid of , that is ; which I don ’ t take to be the fact . ” “ Good again .
Now then , thou not only <unk> to go a-whaling , to find out by experience what whaling is , but ye also want to go in order to see the world ?
Was not that what ye said ?
I thought so .
Well then , just step forward there , and take a peep over the <unk> , and then back to me and tell me what ye see there . ” For a moment I stood a little <unk> by this curious request , not knowing exactly how to take it , whether humorously or in earnest .
But <unk> all his crow ’ s feet into one <unk> , Captain Peleg started me on the errand .
Going forward and glancing over the weather bow , I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the <unk> , was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean .
The prospect was <unk> , but exceedingly <unk> and <unk> ; not the slightest variety that I could see .
“ Well , what ’ s the report ? ” said Peleg when I came back ; “ what did ye see ? ” “ Not much , ” I replied — “ nothing but water ; considerable horizon though , and there ’ s a squall coming up , I think . ” “ Well , what does thou think then of seeing the world ?
Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it , eh ?
Can ’ t ye see the world where you stand ? ” I was a little <unk> , but go a-whaling I must , and I would ; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any — I thought the best — and all this I now repeated to Peleg .
Seeing me so determined , he expressed his <unk> to ship me .
“ And thou <unk> as well sign the papers right off , ” he added — “ come along with ye . ” And so saying , he led the way below deck into the cabin .
<unk> on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure .
It turned out to be Captain Bildad , who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel ; the other <unk> , as is sometimes the case in these ports , being held by a crowd of old <unk> ; widows , <unk> children , and <unk> <unk> ; each <unk> about the value of a timber head , or a foot of plank , or a nail or two in the ship .
People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels , the same way that you do yours in <unk> state <unk> bringing in good interest .
Now , Bildad , like Peleg , and indeed many other Nantucketers , was a Quaker , the island having been originally settled by that <unk> ; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker , only <unk> and <unk> modified by things altogether alien and <unk> .
For some of these same <unk> are the most <unk> of all sailors and <unk> .
They are fighting <unk> ; they are <unk> with a vengeance .
So that there are instances among them of men , who , named with <unk> names — a singularly common fashion on the island — and in <unk> naturally <unk> the stately <unk> thee and thou of the Quaker <unk> ; still , from the audacious , daring , and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives , strangely blend with these <unk> peculiarities , a thousand bold <unk> of character , not unworthy a <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> Pagan Roman .
And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force , with a globular brain and a ponderous heart ; who has also by the <unk> and <unk> of many long <unk> in the remotest waters , and beneath <unk> never seen here at the north , been led to think <unk> and <unk> ; receiving all nature ’ s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin <unk> and <unk> breast , and thereby chiefly , but with some help from <unk> <unk> , to learn a bold and nervous lofty language — that man makes one in a whole nation ’ s census — a mighty <unk> creature , formed for noble <unk> .
Nor will it at all <unk> from him , <unk> regarded , if either by birth or other circumstances , he have what seems a half wilful <unk> <unk> at the bottom of his nature .
For all men <unk> great are made so through a certain <unk> .
Be sure of this , O young <unk> , all mortal <unk> is but <unk> .
But , as yet we have not to do with such an one , but with quite another ; and still a man , who , if indeed peculiar , it only <unk> again from another <unk> of the Quaker , modified by individual circumstances .
Like Captain Peleg , Captain Bildad was a <unk> , retired whaleman .
But unlike Captain Peleg — who <unk> not a rush for what are called serious things , and indeed deemed those <unk> serious things the <unk> of all <unk> — Captain Bildad had not only been originally <unk> according to the <unk> <unk> of Nantucket <unk> , but all his subsequent ocean life , and the sight of many <unk> , lovely island creatures , round the Horn — all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot , had not so much as <unk> one angle of his <unk> .
Still , for all this <unk> , was there some <unk> of common <unk> about worthy Captain Bildad .
Though <unk> , from conscientious <unk> , to bear arms against land <unk> , yet himself had <unk> <unk> the Atlantic and Pacific ; and though a <unk> foe to human <unk> , yet had he in his <unk> coat , spilled <unk> upon <unk> of leviathan <unk> .
How now in the <unk> evening of his days , the pious Bildad <unk> these things in the <unk> , I do not know ; but it did not seem to concern him much , and very probably he had long since come to the <unk> and sensible conclusion that a man ’ s religion is one thing , and this practical world quite another .
This world <unk> <unk> .
<unk> from a little <unk> in short clothes of the <unk> <unk> , to a harpooneer in a broad <unk> <unk> ; from that <unk> <unk> , chief-mate , and captain , and finally a ship owner ; Bildad , as I hinted before , had concluded his adventurous career by wholly <unk> from active life at the <unk> age of sixty , and <unk> his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his <unk> <unk> .
Now , Bildad , I am sorry to say , had the reputation of being an <unk> old <unk> , and in his <unk> days , a bitter , hard <unk> .
They told me in Nantucket , though it certainly seems a curious story , that when he sailed the old <unk> whaleman , his crew , upon <unk> home , were mostly all carried ashore to the <unk> , <unk> exhausted and worn out .
For a pious man , especially for a Quaker , he was certainly rather <unk> , to say the least .
He never used to swear , though , at his men , they said ; but somehow he got an <unk> quantity of cruel , <unk> hard work out of them .
When Bildad was a chief-mate , to have his <unk> eye intently looking at you , made you feel completely nervous , till you could clutch something — a hammer or a <unk> , and go to work like mad , at something or other , never mind what .
<unk> and <unk> perished before him .
His own person was the exact <unk> of his <unk> character .
On his long , gaunt body , he carried no spare flesh , no <unk> beard , his chin having a soft , <unk> nap to it , like the worn nap of his <unk> hat .
Such , then , was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin .
The space between the decks was small ; and there , <unk> , sat old Bildad , who always sat so , and never leaned , and this to save his coat tails .
His <unk> was placed beside him ; his legs were stiffly crossed ; his <unk> <unk> was <unk> up to his chin ; and spectacles on nose , he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume .
“ Bildad , ” cried Captain Peleg , “ at it again , Bildad , eh ?
Ye have been studying those <unk> , now , for the last thirty years , to my certain knowledge .
How far ye got , Bildad ? ” As if long <unk> to such profane talk from his old shipmate , Bildad , without <unk> his present <unk> , quietly looked up , and seeing me , glanced again <unk> towards Peleg .
“ He says he ’ s our man , Bildad , ” said Peleg , “ he wants to ship . ” “ Dost thee ? ” said Bildad , in a hollow tone , and turning round to me .
“ I _ dost _ , ” said I unconsciously , he was so intense a Quaker .
“ What do ye think of him , Bildad ? ” said Peleg .
“ He ’ ll do , ” said Bildad , eyeing me , and then went on <unk> away at his book in a mumbling tone quite <unk> .
I thought him the <unk> old Quaker I ever saw , especially as Peleg , his friend and old shipmate , seemed such a <unk> .
But I said nothing , only looking round me <unk> .
Peleg now threw open a chest , and drawing forth the ship ’ s articles , placed pen and <unk> before him , and seated himself at a little table .
I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to <unk> for the voyage .
I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no <unk> ; but all hands , including the captain , received certain <unk> of the profits called _ lays _ , and that these lays were <unk> to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective <unk> of the ship ’ s company .
I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling , my own lay would not be very large ; but considering that I was used to the sea , could steer a ship , splice a rope , and all that , I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay — that is , the 275th part of the clear <unk> proceeds of the voyage , whatever that might eventually amount to .
And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather _ long lay _ , yet it was better than nothing ; and if we had a lucky voyage , might pretty nearly pay for the <unk> I would wear out on it , not to speak of my three years ’ beef and board , for which I would not have to pay one <unk> .
It might be thought that this was a poor way to <unk> a <unk> <unk> — and so it was , a very poor way indeed .
But I am one of those that never take on about <unk> <unk> , and am quite content if the world is ready to board and <unk> me , while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder <unk> .
Upon the whole , I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing , but would not have been surprised had I been offered the <unk> , considering I was of a <unk> make .
But one thing , nevertheless , that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this : <unk> , I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old <unk> Bildad ; how that they being the principal <unk> of the Pequod , therefore the other and more <unk> and scattered owners , left nearly the whole management of the ship ’ s affairs to these two .
And I did not know but what the <unk> old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands , especially as I now found him on board the Pequod , quite at home there in the cabin , and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside .
Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife , old Bildad , to my no small surprise , considering that he was such an <unk> party in these proceedings ; Bildad never heeded us , but went on mumbling to himself out of his book , “ _ Lay _ not up for yourselves <unk> upon earth , where <unk> — ” “ Well , Captain Bildad , ” interrupted Peleg , “ what d ’ ye say , what lay shall we give this young man ? ” “ Thou knowest best , ” was the <unk> reply , “ the seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn ’ t be too much , would it ? — ‘ where <unk> and rust do corrupt , but _ lay _ — ’ ” _ Lay _ , indeed , thought I , and such a lay !
the seven hundred and seventy-seventh !
Well , old Bildad , you are determined that I , for one , shall not _ lay _ up many _ lays _ here below , where <unk> and rust do corrupt .
It was an exceedingly _ long lay _ that , indeed ; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first <unk> a landsman , yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and <unk> is a pretty large number , yet , when you come to make a _ <unk> _ of it , you will then see , I say , that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a <unk> is a good deal less than seven hundred and <unk> gold doubloons ; and so I thought at the time .
“ Why , blast your eyes , Bildad , ” cried Peleg , “ thou dost not want to <unk> this young man !
he must have more than that . ” “ <unk> hundred and seventy-seventh , ” again said Bildad , without lifting his eyes ; and then went on mumbling — “ for where your <unk> is , there will your heart be also . ” “ I am going to put him down for the three <unk> , ” said Peleg , “ do ye hear that , Bildad !
The three <unk> lay , I say . ” Bildad laid down his book , and turning solemnly towards him said , “ Captain Peleg , thou hast a generous heart ; but thou must consider the duty thou <unk> to the other owners of this ship — widows and orphans , many of them — and that if we too <unk> reward the <unk> of this young man , we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans .
The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay , Captain Peleg . ” “ Thou Bildad ! ” roared Peleg , starting up and <unk> about the cabin .
“ Blast ye , Captain Bildad , if I had followed thy advice in these matters , I would afore now had a conscience to <unk> about that would be heavy enough to <unk> the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn . ” “ Captain Peleg , ” said Bildad steadily , “ thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water , or ten fathoms , I can ’ t tell ; but as thou art still an <unk> man , Captain Peleg , I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one ; and will in the end sink thee <unk> down to the fiery pit , Captain Peleg . ” “ <unk> pit !
fiery pit !
ye insult me , man ; past all natural bearing , ye insult me .
It ’ s an <unk> <unk> to tell any human creature that he ’ s bound to hell .
<unk> and flames !
Bildad , say that again to me , and start my <unk> , but I ’ ll — I ’ ll — yes , I ’ ll swallow a live <unk> with all his hair and horns on .
Out of the cabin , ye <unk> , <unk> son of a wooden gun — a straight wake with ye ! ” As he <unk> out this he made a rush at Bildad , but with a marvellous <unk> , sliding <unk> , Bildad for that time <unk> him .
<unk> at this terrible <unk> between the two principal and <unk> owners of the ship , and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so <unk> owned and temporarily commanded , I stepped aside from the door to give <unk> to Bildad , who , I made no doubt , was all eagerness to <unk> from before the awakened wrath of Peleg .
But to my astonishment , he sat down again on the transom very quietly , and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing .
He seemed quite used to <unk> Peleg and his ways .
As for Peleg , after <unk> off his rage as he had , there seemed no more left in him , and he , too , sat down like a <unk> , though he <unk> a little as if still <unk> agitated .
“ <unk> ! ” he <unk> at last — “ the squall ’ s gone off to leeward , I think .
Bildad , thou used to be good at <unk> a lance , mend that pen , will ye .
My jack-knife here needs the <unk> .
That ’ s he ; thank ye , Bildad .
Now then , my young man , Ishmael ’ s thy name , didn ’ t ye say ?
Well then , down ye go here , Ishmael , for the three <unk> lay . ” “ Captain Peleg , ” said I , “ I have a friend with me who wants to ship too — shall I bring him down to-morrow ? ” “ To be sure , ” said Peleg .
“ <unk> him along , and we ’ ll look at him . ” “ What lay does he want ? ” <unk> Bildad , glancing up from the book in which he had again been <unk> himself .
“ Oh !
never thee mind about that , Bildad , ” said Peleg .
“ Has he ever <unk> it any ? ” turning to me .
“ <unk> more whales than I can <unk> , Captain Peleg . ” “ Well , bring him along then . ” And , after <unk> the papers , off I went ; nothing <unk> but that I had done a good morning ’ s work , and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape .
But I had not proceeded far , when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me ; though , indeed , in many cases , a whale-ship will be completely fitted out , and receive all her crew on board , ere the captain makes himself visible by <unk> to take command ; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged , and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief , that if the captain have a family , or any <unk> <unk> of that sort , he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port , but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea .
However , it is always as well to have a look at him before <unk> <unk> yourself into his hands .
<unk> back I accosted Captain Peleg , inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found .
“ And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab ?
It ’ s all right enough ; thou art shipped . ” “ Yes , but I should like to see him . ” “ But I don ’ t think thou wilt be able to at present .
I don ’ t know exactly what ’ s the matter with him ; but he keeps close inside the house ; a sort of sick , and yet he don ’ t look so .
In fact , he ain ’ t sick ; but no , he <unk> ’ t well either .
Any how , young man , he won ’ t always see me , so I don ’ t suppose he will thee .
He ’ s a queer man , Captain Ahab — so some think — but a good one .
Oh , thou ’ <unk> like him well enough ; no fear , no fear .
He ’ s a grand , <unk> , <unk> man , Captain Ahab ; <unk> ’ t speak much ; but , when he does speak , then you may well listen .
Mark ye , be <unk> ; Ahab ’ s above the common ; Ahab ’ s been in <unk> , as well as ’ <unk> the cannibals ; been used to deeper wonders than the waves ; fixed his fiery lance in <unk> , stranger foes than whales .
His lance !
aye , the <unk> and the <unk> that out of all our isle !
Oh !
he ain ’ t Captain Bildad ; no , and he ain ’ t Captain Peleg ; _ he ’ s Ahab _ , boy ; and Ahab of old , thou knowest , was a <unk> king ! ” “ And a very vile one .
When that wicked king was slain , the dogs , did they not <unk> his blood ? ” “ Come hither to me — hither , hither , ” said Peleg , with a significance in his eye that almost startled me .
“ Look ye , lad ; never say that on board the Pequod .
Never say it anywhere .
Captain Ahab did not name himself .
’ <unk> a foolish , ignorant <unk> of his crazy , <unk> mother , who died when he was only a <unk> old .
And yet the old <unk> <unk> , at <unk> , said that the name would somehow prove <unk> .
And , perhaps , other <unk> like her may tell thee the same .
I wish to <unk> thee .
It ’ s a lie .
I know Captain Ahab well ; I ’ ve sailed with him as mate years ago ; I know what he is — a good man — not a pious , good man , like Bildad , but a swearing good man — something like me — only there ’ s a good deal more of him .
Aye , aye , I know that he was never very jolly ; and I know that on the passage home , he was a little out of his mind for a spell ; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his <unk> stump that brought that about , as any one might see .
I know , too , that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale , he ’ s been a kind of moody — desperate moody , and savage sometimes ; but that will all pass off .
And once for all , let me tell thee and assure thee , young man , it ’ s better to sail with a moody good captain than a <unk> bad one .
So good-bye to thee — and wrong not Captain Ahab , because he happens to have a wicked name .
Besides , my boy , he has a wife — not three voyages wedded — a sweet , <unk> girl .
Think of that ; by that sweet girl that old man has a child : hold ye then there can be any utter , hopeless harm in Ahab ?
No , no , my lad ; stricken , blasted , if he be , Ahab has his <unk> ! ” As I walked away , I was full of <unk> ; what had been incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab , filled me with a certain wild <unk> of <unk> concerning him .
And somehow , at the time , I felt a <unk> and a sorrow for him , but for I don ’ t know what , unless it was the cruel loss of his leg .
And yet I also felt a strange awe of him ; but that sort of awe , which I cannot at all <unk> , was not exactly awe ; I do not know what it was .
But I felt it ; and it did not <unk> me towards him ; though I felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him , so <unk> as he was known to me then .
However , my thoughts were at length carried in other directions , so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Ramadan .
As Queequeg ’ s Ramadan , or <unk> and <unk> , was to continue all day , I did not choose to <unk> him till towards <unk> ; for I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody ’ s <unk> <unk> , never mind how comical , and could not find it in my heart to <unk> even a congregation of <unk> worshipping a <unk> ; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth , who with a degree of <unk> quite <unk> in other <unk> , bow down before the <unk> of a <unk> landed <unk> merely on account of the <unk> <unk> yet owned and <unk> in his name .
I say , we good <unk> Christians should be charitable in these things , and not fancy ourselves so <unk> superior to other mortals , pagans and what not , because of their <unk> conceits on these subjects .
There was Queequeg , now , certainly <unk> the most <unk> <unk> about Yojo and his Ramadan ; — but what of that ?
Queequeg thought he knew what he was about , I suppose ; he seemed to be content ; and there let him rest .
All our <unk> with him would not <unk> ; let him be , I say : and Heaven have mercy on us all — <unk> and <unk> alike — for we are all somehow <unk> cracked about the head , and sadly need <unk> .
Towards evening , when I felt assured that all his performances and <unk> must be over , I went up to his room and knocked at the door ; but no answer .
I tried to open it , but it was fastened inside .
“ Queequeg , ” said I softly through the <unk> : — all silent .
“ I say , Queequeg !
why don ’ t you speak ?
It ’ s I — Ishmael . ” But all remained still as before .
I began to grow alarmed .
I had allowed him such <unk> time ; I thought he might have had an <unk> fit .
I looked through the <unk> ; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room , the <unk> prospect was but a crooked and <unk> one .
I could only see part of the <unk> of the bed and a line of the wall , but nothing more .
I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden <unk> of Queequeg ’ s harpoon , which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him , before our <unk> to the <unk> .
That ’ s strange , thought I ; but at any rate , since the harpoon stands yonder , and he seldom or never goes abroad without it , therefore he must be inside here , and no possible mistake .
“ Queequeg ! — Queequeg ! ” — all still .
Something must have happened .
<unk> !
I tried to burst open the door ; but it <unk> <unk> .
<unk> down stairs , I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I met — the <unk> .
“ <unk> !
la ! ” she cried , “ I thought something must be the matter .
I went to make the bed after breakfast , and the door was locked ; and not a <unk> to be heard ; and it ’ s been just so silent ever since .
But I thought , may be , you had both gone off and locked your <unk> in for safe keeping .
<unk> !
la , <unk> ’ am ! — <unk> !
murder !
Mrs. Hussey !
<unk> ! ” — and with these cries , she ran towards the kitchen , I following .
Mrs. Hussey soon appeared , with a <unk> in one hand and a vinegar-cruet in the other , having just broken away from the <unk> of attending to the <unk> , and scolding her little black boy <unk> .
“ <unk> ! ” cried I , “ which way to it ?
<unk> for God ’ s sake , and fetch something to pry open the door — the axe ! — the axe !
he ’ s had a stroke ; depend upon it ! ” — and so saying I was <unk> rushing up stairs again <unk> , when Mrs. Hussey <unk> the <unk> and vinegar-cruet , and the entire <unk> of her countenance .
“ What ’ s the matter with you , young man ? ” “ <unk> the axe !
For God ’ s sake , run for the <unk> , some one , while I pry it open ! ” “ Look here , ” said the landlady , quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet , so as to have one hand free ; “ look here ; are you talking about <unk> open any of my doors ? ” — and with that she seized my arm .
“ What ’ s the matter with you ?
What ’ s the matter with you , shipmate ? ” In as calm , but rapid a manner as possible , I gave her to understand the whole case .
<unk> clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of her nose , she <unk> for an instant ; then exclaimed — “ No !
I haven ’ t seen it since I put it there . ” <unk> to a little <unk> under the <unk> of the stairs , she glanced in , and returning , told me that Queequeg ’ s harpoon was missing .
“ He ’ s killed himself , ” she cried .
“ It ’ s <unk> ’ <unk> <unk> done over again — there goes another counterpane — God pity his poor mother ! — it will be the ruin of my house .
Has the poor lad a sister ?
Where ’ s that girl ? — there , <unk> , go to <unk> the <unk> , and tell him to paint me a sign , with — “ no <unk> permitted here , and no smoking in the parlor ; ” — might as well kill both birds at once .
<unk> ?
The Lord be <unk> to his ghost !
What ’ s that noise there ?
You , young man , avast there ! ” And running up after me , she caught me as I was again trying to force open the door .
“ I don ’ t allow it ; I won ’ t have my <unk> spoiled .
Go for the <unk> , there ’ s one about a mile from here .
But avast ! ” putting her hand in her <unk> , “ here ’ s a key that ’ ll fit , I guess ; let ’ s see . ” And with that , she turned it in the lock ; but , alas !
Queequeg ’ s <unk> bolt remained <unk> within .
“ Have to burst it open , ” said I , and was running down the entry a little , for a good start , when the landlady caught at me , again <unk> I should not break down her <unk> ; but I tore from her , and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark .
With a prodigious noise the door flew open , and the <unk> <unk> against the wall , sent the <unk> to the ceiling ; and there , good heavens !
there sat Queequeg , altogether cool and <unk> ; right in the middle of the room ; <unk> on his hams , and holding Yojo on top of his head .
He looked neither one way nor the other way , but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life .
“ Queequeg , ” said I , going up to him , “ Queequeg , what ’ s the matter with you ? ” “ He <unk> ’ t been a <unk> ’ so all day , has he ? ” said the landlady .
But all we said , not a word could we drag out of him ; I almost felt like pushing him over , so as to change his position , for it was almost intolerable , it seemed so <unk> and <unk> <unk> ; especially , as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours , going too without his regular meals .
“ Mrs.
Hussey , ” said I , “ he ’ s _ alive _ at all events ; so leave us , if you please , and I will see to this strange affair myself . ” <unk> the door upon the landlady , I <unk> to <unk> upon Queequeg to take a chair ; but in vain .
There he sat ; and all he could do — for all my polite <unk> and <unk> — he would not move a <unk> , nor say a single word , nor even look at me , nor notice my presence in the slightest way .
I wonder , thought I , if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan ; do they fast on their hams that way in his native island .
It must be so ; yes , it ’ s part of his <unk> , I suppose ; well , then , let him rest ; he ’ ll get up sooner or <unk> , no doubt .
It can ’ t last for ever , thank God , and his Ramadan only comes once a year ; and I don ’ t believe it ’ s very <unk> then .
I went down to supper .
After sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a <unk> voyage , as they called it ( that is , a short <unk> in a schooner or <unk> , <unk> to the north of the line , in the Atlantic Ocean only ) ; after listening to these <unk> till nearly <unk> o ’ clock , I went up stairs to go to bed , feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a <unk> .
But no ; there he was just where I had left him ; he had not stirred an inch .
I began to grow <unk> with him ; it seemed so downright <unk> and <unk> to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room , holding a piece of wood on his head .
“ For heaven ’ s sake , Queequeg , get up and shake yourself ; get up and have some supper .
You ’ ll <unk> ; you ’ ll kill yourself , Queequeg . ” But not a word did he reply .
<unk> of him , therefore , I determined to go to bed and to sleep ; and no doubt , before a great while , he would follow me .
But previous to turning in , I took my heavy <unk> jacket , and threw it over him , as it <unk> to be a very cold night ; and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on .
For some time , do all I would , I could not get into the <unk> doze .
I had blown out the candle ; and the mere thought of Queequeg — not four feet off — sitting there in that <unk> position , stark alone in the cold and dark ; this made me really wretched .
Think of it ; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary , unaccountable Ramadan !
But somehow I dropped off at last , and knew nothing more till break of day ; when , looking over the <unk> , there <unk> Queequeg , as if he had been screwed down to the floor .
But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window , up he got , with stiff and <unk> joints , but with a cheerful look ; <unk> towards me where I lay ; pressed his forehead again against mine ; and said his Ramadan was over .
Now , as I before hinted , I have no <unk> to any person ’ s religion , be it what it may , so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person , because that other person don ’ t believe it also .
But when a man ’ s religion becomes really frantic ; when it is a <unk> <unk> to him ; and , in fine , makes this earth of ours an <unk> inn to <unk> in ; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and <unk> the point with him .
And just so I now did with Queequeg .
“ Queequeg , ” said I , “ get into bed now , and lie and listen to me . ” I then went on , beginning with the rise and progress of the <unk> <unk> , and coming down to the various <unk> of the present time , during which time I <unk> to show Queequeg that all these <unk> , <unk> , and prolonged <unk> in cold , <unk> <unk> were stark nonsense ; bad for the health ; useless for the soul ; <unk> , in short , to the obvious laws of <unk> and common sense .
I told him , too , that he being in other things such an <unk> sensible and sagacious savage , it <unk> me , very badly <unk> me , to see him now so <unk> foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his .
Besides , argued I , <unk> makes the body cave in ; hence the spirit <unk> in ; and all thoughts born of a fast must <unk> be <unk> .
This is the reason why most <unk> <unk> cherish such melancholy <unk> about their <unk> .
In one word , Queequeg , said I , rather <unk> ; hell is an idea first born on an <unk> <unk> ; and since then <unk> through the hereditary <unk> nurtured by <unk> .
I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia ; <unk> the idea very plainly , so that he could take it in .
He said no ; only upon one <unk> occasion .
It was after a great feast given by his father the king , on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o ’ clock in the afternoon , and all cooked and <unk> that very evening .
“ No more , Queequeg , ” said I , shuddering ; “ that will do ; ” for I knew the <unk> without his further <unk> them .
I had seen a sailor who had visited that very island , and he told me that it was the custom , when a great battle had been gained there , to <unk> all the slain in the yard or garden of the <unk> ; and then , one by one , they were placed in great wooden <unk> , and <unk> round like a <unk> , with <unk> and <unk> ; and with some <unk> in their mouths , were sent round with the <unk> ’ s <unk> to all his friends , just as though these presents were so many Christmas <unk> .
After all , I do not think that my <unk> about religion made much impression upon Queequeg .
Because , in the first place , he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject , unless considered from his own point of view ; and , in the second place , he did not more than one third understand me , <unk> my ideas simply as I would ; and , finally , he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did .
He looked at me with a sort of <unk> concern and <unk> , as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to <unk> pagan <unk> .
At last we rose and dressed ; and Queequeg , taking a <unk> hearty breakfast of <unk> of all sorts , so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan , we sallied out to board the Pequod , sauntering along , and picking our teeth with <unk> bones .
CHAPTER <unk> .
His Mark .
As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship , Queequeg carrying his harpoon , Captain Peleg in his <unk> voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam , saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal , and <unk> announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft , unless they previously produced their papers .
“ What do you mean by that , Captain Peleg ? ” said I , now <unk> on the bulwarks , and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf .
“ I mean , ” he replied , “ he must show his papers . ” “ Yes , ” said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice , sticking his head from behind Peleg ’ s , out of the wigwam .
“ He must show that he ’ s converted .
<unk> of darkness , ” he added , turning to Queequeg , “ art thou at present in <unk> with any Christian church ? ” “ Why , ” said I , “ he ’ s a member of the first <unk> Church . ” Here be it said , that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches .
“ First <unk> Church , ” cried Bildad , “ what !
that <unk> in Deacon Deuteronomy <unk> ’ s <unk> ? ” and so saying , taking out his spectacles , he <unk> them with his great yellow <unk> handkerchief , and putting them on very carefully , came out of the wigwam , and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks , took a good long look at Queequeg .
“ How long hath he been a member ? ” he then said , turning to me ; “ not very long , I rather guess , young man . ” “ No , ” said Peleg , “ and he hasn ’ t been <unk> right either , or it would have washed some of that devil ’ s blue off his face . ” “ Do tell , now , ” cried Bildad , “ is this <unk> a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomy ’ s meeting ?
I never saw him going there , and I pass it every Lord ’ s day . ” “ I don ’ t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting , ” said I ; “ all I know is , that Queequeg here is a born member of the First <unk> Church .
He is a <unk> himself , Queequeg is . ” “ Young man , ” said Bildad <unk> , “ thou art <unk> with me — explain thyself , thou young <unk> .
What church dost thee mean ?
answer me . ” <unk> myself thus hard pushed , I replied .
“ I mean , sir , the same ancient <unk> Church to which you and I , and Captain Peleg there , and Queequeg here , and all of us , and every mother ’ s son and soul of us belong ; the great and everlasting First <unk> of this whole worshipping world ; we all belong to that ; only some of us cherish some queer <unk> no ways touching the grand belief ; in _ that _ we all join hands . ” “ <unk> , thou mean ’ st _ splice _ hands , ” cried Peleg , drawing nearer .
“ Young man , you ’ d better ship for a <unk> , instead of a <unk> hand ; I never heard a better <unk> .
Deacon Deuteronomy — why Father Mapple himself couldn ’ t beat it , and he ’ s <unk> something .
Come aboard , come aboard ; never mind about the papers .
I say , tell Quohog there — what ’ s that you call him ?
tell Quohog to step along .
By the great anchor , what a harpoon he ’ s got there !
looks like good stuff that ; and he <unk> it about right .
I say , Quohog , or whatever your name is , did you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat ?
did you ever strike a fish ? ” <unk> saying a word , Queequeg , in his wild sort of way , jumped upon the bulwarks , from thence into the bows of one of the <unk> hanging to the side ; and then bracing his left knee , and <unk> his harpoon , cried out in some such way as this : — “ <unk> ’ ain , you see him small drop tar on water <unk> ?
You see him ?
well , <unk> him one whale eye , well , den ! ” and taking sharp <unk> at it , he darted the iron right over old Bildad ’ s broad <unk> , clean across the ship ’ s decks , and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight .
“ Now , ” said Queequeg , quietly hauling in the line , “ <unk> him <unk> eye ; why , <unk> whale dead . ” “ Quick , Bildad , ” said Peleg , his <unk> , who , aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon , had retreated towards the cabin gangway .
“ Quick , I say , you Bildad , and get the ship ’ s papers .
We must have <unk> there , I mean Quohog , in one of our boats .
Look ye , Quohog , we ’ ll give ye the <unk> lay , and that ’ s more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket . ” So down we went into the cabin , and to my great joy Queequeg was soon <unk> among the same ship ’ s company to which I myself belonged .
When all <unk> were over and Peleg had got everything ready for <unk> , he turned to me and said , “ I guess , Quohog there don ’ t know how to write , does he ?
I say , Quohog , blast ye !
dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark ? ” But at this question , Queequeg , who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar <unk> , looked no ways <unk> ; but taking the offered pen , copied upon the paper , in the proper place , an exact <unk> of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm ; so that through Captain Peleg ’ s <unk> mistake touching his <unk> , it stood something like this : — Quohog .
his <unk> mark .
Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg , and at last rising solemnly and <unk> in the huge pockets of his <unk> <unk> coat , took out a <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> one entitled “ The <unk> Day Coming ; or No Time to <unk> , ” placed it in Queequeg ’ s hands , and then grasping them and the book with both his , looked earnestly into his eyes , and said , “ <unk> of darkness , I must do my duty by thee ; I am part owner of this ship , and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew ; if thou still <unk> to thy Pagan ways , which I sadly fear , I <unk> thee , remain not for aye a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the idol <unk> , and the hideous dragon ; turn from the wrath to come ; mind thine eye , I say ; oh !
goodness gracious !
steer clear of the fiery pit ! ” Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad ’ s language , <unk> mixed with <unk> and domestic <unk> .
“ Avast there , avast there , Bildad , avast now <unk> our harpooneer , ” cried Peleg .
“ <unk> harpooneers never make good <unk> — it takes the shark out of ’ em ; no harpooneer is worth a <unk> who <unk> pretty <unk> .
There was young <unk> <unk> , once the <unk> <unk> out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard ; he joined the meeting , and never came to good .
He got so frightened about his <unk> soul , that he <unk> and <unk> away from whales , for fear of <unk> , in case he got stove and went to <unk> <unk> . ” “ Peleg !
Peleg ! ” said Bildad , lifting his eyes and hands , “ thou thyself , as I myself , hast seen many a perilous time ; thou knowest , Peleg , what it is to have the fear of death ; how , then , can ’ st thou <unk> in this <unk> <unk> .
Thou <unk> thine own heart , Peleg .
Tell me , when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that <unk> on Japan , that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab , did ’ st thou not think of Death and the <unk> then ? ” “ <unk> him , hear him now , ” cried Peleg , marching across the cabin , and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets , — “ hear him , all of ye .
Think of that !
When every moment we thought the ship would sink !
Death and the <unk> then ?
What ?
With all three masts making such an everlasting <unk> against the side ; and every sea breaking over us , fore and aft .
Think of Death and the <unk> then ?
No !
no time to think about Death then .
Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of ; and how to save all hands — how to rig <unk> — how to get into the nearest port ; that was what I was thinking of . ” Bildad said no more , but <unk> up his coat , <unk> on deck , where we followed him .
There he stood , very quietly <unk> some <unk> who were <unk> a <unk> in the waist .
Now and then he stooped to pick up a <unk> , or save an end of <unk> twine , which otherwise might have been wasted .

“ Shipmates , have ye shipped in that ship ? ” Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod , and were sauntering away from the water , for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts , when the above words were put to us by a stranger , who , pausing before us , levelled his massive <unk> at the vessel in question .
He was but <unk> <unk> in faded jacket and patched trowsers ; a <unk> of a black handkerchief <unk> his neck .
A <unk> <unk> had in all directions flowed over his face , and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a <unk> , when the rushing waters have been dried up .
“ Have ye shipped in her ? ” he repeated .
“ You mean the ship Pequod , I suppose , ” said I , trying to gain a little more time for an <unk> look at him .
“ Aye , the Pequod — that ship there , ” he said , drawing back his whole arm , and then rapidly <unk> it straight out from him , with the fixed <unk> of his pointed finger darted full at the object .
“ Yes , ” said I , “ we have just signed the articles . ” “ <unk> down there about your souls ? ” “ About what ? ” “ Oh , perhaps you hav ’ n ’ t got any , ” he said quickly .
“ No matter though , I know many chaps that hav ’ n ’ t got any , — good luck to ’ em ; and they are all the better off for it .
A soul ’ s a sort of a fifth wheel to a <unk> . ” “ What are you <unk> about , shipmate ? ” said I.
“ _ He ’ s _ got enough , though , to make up for all <unk> of that sort in other chaps , ” <unk> said the stranger , placing a nervous <unk> upon the word _ he _ .
“ Queequeg , ” said I , “ let ’ s go ; this fellow has broken loose from somewhere ; he ’ s talking about something and somebody we don ’ t know . ” “ Stop ! ” cried the stranger .
“ Ye said true — ye hav ’ n ’ t seen Old Thunder yet , have ye ? ” “ Who ’ s Old Thunder ? ” said I , again riveted with the <unk> <unk> of his manner .
“ Captain Ahab . ” “ What !
the captain of our ship , the Pequod ? ” “ Aye , among some of us old sailor chaps , he goes by that name .
Ye hav ’ n ’ t seen him yet , have ye ? ” “ No , we hav ’ n ’ t .
He ’ s sick they say , but is getting better , and will be all right again before long . ” “ All right again before long ! ” laughed the stranger , with a solemnly <unk> sort of laugh .
“ Look ye ; when Captain Ahab is all right , then this left arm of mine will be all right ; not before . ” “ What do you know about him ? ” “ What did they _ tell _ you about him ?
Say that ! ” “ They didn ’ t tell much of anything about him ; only I ’ ve heard that he ’ s a good whale-hunter , and a good captain to his crew . ” “ That ’ s true , that ’ s true — yes , both true enough .
But you must jump when he gives an order .
<unk> and <unk> ; <unk> and go — that ’ s the word with Captain Ahab .
But nothing about that thing that happened to him off Cape Horn , long ago , when he lay like dead for three days and nights ; nothing about that deadly <unk> with the <unk> afore the altar in <unk> ? — heard nothing about that , eh ?
Nothing about the silver <unk> he <unk> into ?
And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage , according to the prophecy .
Didn ’ t ye hear a word about them matters and something more , eh ?
No , I don ’ t think ye did ; how could ye ?
Who knows it ?
Not all Nantucket , I guess .
But <unk> ’ ever , <unk> , ye ’ ve heard tell about the leg , and how he lost it ; aye , ye have heard of that , I dare say .
Oh yes , _ that _ every one knows a ’ most — I mean they know he ’ s only one leg ; and that a <unk> took the other off . ” “ My friend , ” said I , “ what all this <unk> of yours is about , I don ’ t know , and I don ’ t much care ; for it seems to me that you must be a little <unk> in the head .
But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab , of that ship there , the Pequod , then let me tell you , that I know all about the loss of his leg . ” “ _ All _ about it , eh — sure you do ? — all ? ” “ <unk> sure . ” With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod , the <unk> stranger stood a moment , as if in a troubled <unk> ; then starting a little , turned and said : — “ Ye ’ ve shipped , have ye ?
<unk> down on the papers ?
Well , well , what ’ s signed , is signed ; and what ’ s to be , will be ; and then again , perhaps it won ’ t be , after all .
<unk> , it ’ s all fixed and <unk> a ’ ready ; and some sailors or other must go with him , I suppose ; as well these as any other men , God pity ’ em !
Morning to ye , shipmates , morning ; the <unk> heavens bless ye ; I ’ m sorry I stopped ye . ” “ Look here , friend , ” said I , “ if you have anything important to tell us , out with it ; but if you are only trying to <unk> us , you are mistaken in your game ; that ’ s all I have to say . ” “ And it ’ s said very well , and I like to hear a chap talk up that way ; you are just the man for him — the <unk> of ye .
Morning to ye , shipmates , morning !
Oh !
when ye get there , tell ’ em I ’ ve concluded not to make one of ’ em . ” “ Ah , my dear fellow , you can ’ t fool us that way — you can ’ t fool us .
It is the <unk> thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him . ” “ Morning to ye , shipmates , morning . ” “ Morning it is , ” said I.
“ Come along , Queequeg , let ’ s leave this crazy man .
But stop , tell me your name , will you ? ” “ Elijah . ” Elijah !
thought I , and we walked away , both <unk> , after each other ’ s fashion , upon this ragged old sailor ; and agreed that he was nothing but a <unk> , trying to be a <unk> .
But we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards , when chancing to turn a corner , and looking back as I did so , who should be seen but Elijah following us , though at a distance .
<unk> , the sight of him struck me so , that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind , but passed on with my comrade , anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did .
He did ; and then it seemed to me that he was <unk> us , but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine .
This circumstance , <unk> with his <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , shrouded sort of talk , now <unk> in me all <unk> of vague <unk> and <unk> , and all connected with the Pequod ; and Captain Ahab ; and the leg he had lost ; and the Cape Horn fit ; and the silver <unk> ; and what Captain Peleg had said of him , when I left the ship the day previous ; and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ; and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail ; and a hundred other <unk> things .
I was resolved to <unk> myself whether this ragged Elijah was really <unk> us or not , and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg , and on that side of it <unk> our steps .
But Elijah passed on , without seeming to notice us .
This relieved me ; and once more , and finally as it seemed to me , I pronounced him in my heart , a <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> .
All <unk> .
A day or two passed , and there was great activity aboard the Pequod .
Not only were the old sails being <unk> , but new sails were coming on board , and bolts of canvas , and coils of rigging ; in short , everything betokened that the ship ’ s <unk> were hurrying to a close .
Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore , but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands : Bildad did all the <unk> and providing at the <unk> ; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after <unk> .
On the day following Queequeg ’ s <unk> the articles , word was given at all the <unk> where the ship ’ s company were stopping , that their <unk> must be on board before night , for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing .
So Queequeg and I got down our <unk> , <unk> , however , to sleep ashore till the last .
But it seems they always give very long notice in these cases , and the ship did not sail for several days .
But no wonder ; there was a good deal to be done , and there is no telling how many things to be thought of , before the Pequod was fully <unk> .
Every one knows what a multitude of things — <unk> , <unk> , knives and <unk> , <unk> and tongs , <unk> , <unk> , and what not , are indispensable to the business of <unk> .
Just so with whaling , which <unk> a <unk> ’ <unk> upon the wide ocean , far from all <unk> , <unk> , doctors , <unk> , and <unk> .
And though this also holds true of merchant vessels , yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen .
For besides the great length of the whaling voyage , the numerous articles peculiar to the <unk> of the fishery , and the <unk> of <unk> them at the remote harbors usually frequented , it must be remembered , that of all ships , whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all <unk> , and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends .
Hence , the spare boats , spare spars , and spare lines and harpoons , and spare <unk> , almost , but a spare Captain and <unk> ship .
At the period of our arrival at the Island , the <unk> <unk> of the Pequod had been almost completed ; comprising her beef , bread , water , fuel , and iron hoops and <unk> .
But , as before hinted , for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things , both large and small .
Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain Bildad ’ s sister , a lean old lady of a most determined and <unk> spirit , but <unk> very <unk> , who seemed resolved that , if _ she _ could help it , nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod , after once fairly getting to sea .
At one time she would come on board with a <unk> of <unk> for the steward ’ s <unk> ; another time with a bunch of <unk> for the chief mate ’ s desk , where he kept his log ; a third time with a roll of <unk> for the small of some one ’ s <unk> back .
Never did any woman better <unk> her name , which was Charity — Aunt Charity , as everybody called her .
And like a sister of <unk> did this charitable Aunt Charity <unk> about hither and thither , ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that <unk> to yield safety , comfort , and <unk> to all on board a ship in which her <unk> brother Bildad was concerned , and in which she herself owned a score or two of <unk> dollars .
But it was <unk> to see this excellent <unk> <unk> coming on board , as she did the last day , with a long <unk> in one hand , and a still longer whaling lance in the other .
Nor was Bildad himself nor Captain Peleg at all backward .
As for Bildad , he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed , and at every fresh arrival , down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper .
Every once in a while Peleg came <unk> out of his whalebone den , roaring at the men down the <unk> , roaring up to the <unk> at the mast-head , and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam .
During these days of <unk> , Queequeg and I often visited the craft , and as often I asked about Captain Ahab , and how he was , and when he was going to come on board his ship .
To these questions they would answer , that he was getting better and better , and was expected aboard every day ; <unk> , the two captains , Peleg and Bildad , could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage .
If I had been downright honest with myself , I would have seen very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being <unk> this way to so long a voyage , without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute <unk> of it , so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea .
But when a man <unk> any wrong , it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter , he <unk> <unk> to cover up his suspicions even from himself .
And much this way it was with me .
I said nothing , and tried to think nothing .
At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail .
So next morning , Queequeg and I took a very early start .
CHAPTER <unk> .
Going <unk> .
It was nearly six o ’ clock , but only grey <unk> <unk> dawn , when we drew nigh the wharf .
“ There are some sailors running ahead there , if I see right , ” said I to Queequeg , “ it can ’ t be shadows ; she ’ s off by sunrise , I guess ; come on ! ” “ Avast ! ” cried a voice , whose owner at the same time coming close behind us , laid a hand upon both our shoulders , and then <unk> himself between us , stood stooping forward a little , in the uncertain twilight , strangely peering from Queequeg to me .
It was Elijah .
“ Going aboard ? ” “ Hands off , will you , ” said I.
“ <unk> here , ” said Queequeg , shaking himself , “ go ’ way ! ” “ <unk> ’ t going aboard , then ? ” “ Yes , we are , ” said I , “ but what business is that of yours ?
Do you know , Mr. Elijah , that I consider you a little <unk> ? ” “ No , no , no ; I wasn ’ t aware of that , ” said Elijah , slowly and <unk> looking from me to Queequeg , with the most unaccountable glances .
“ Elijah , ” said I , “ you will <unk> my friend and me by withdrawing .
We are going to the Indian and Pacific <unk> , and would <unk> not to be <unk> . ” “ Ye be , be ye ?
Coming back afore breakfast ? ” “ He ’ s cracked , Queequeg , ” said I , “ come on . ” “ <unk> ! ” cried stationary Elijah , hailing us when we had removed a few <unk> .
“ Never mind him , ” said I , “ Queequeg , come on . ” But he stole up to us again , and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder , said — “ Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago ? ” <unk> by this plain <unk> question , I answered , saying , “ Yes , I thought I did see four or five men ; but it was too dim to be sure . ” “ Very dim , very dim , ” said Elijah .
“ Morning to ye . ” Once more we quitted him ; but once more he came softly after us ; and touching my shoulder again , said , “ See if you can find ’ em now , will ye ?
“ <unk> who ? ” “ Morning to ye !
morning to ye ! ” he <unk> , again moving off .
“ Oh !
I was going to <unk> ye against — but never mind , never mind — it ’ s all one , all in the family too ; — sharp frost this morning , ain ’ t it ?
Good-bye to ye .
<unk> ’ t see ye again very soon , I guess ; unless it ’ s before the Grand <unk> . ” And with these cracked words he finally departed , leaving me , for the moment , in no small <unk> at his frantic <unk> .
At last , stepping on board the Pequod , we found everything in profound quiet , not a soul moving .
The cabin entrance was locked within ; the hatches were all on , and <unk> with coils of rigging .
Going forward to the forecastle , we found the slide of the scuttle open .
Seeing a light , we went down , and found only an old <unk> there , wrapped in a <unk> <unk> .
He was thrown at whole length upon two <unk> , his face downwards and <unk> in his folded arms .
The profoundest <unk> slept upon him .
“ Those sailors we saw , Queequeg , where can they have gone to ? ” said I , looking <unk> at the sleeper .
But it seemed that , when on the wharf , Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to ; hence I would have thought myself to have been <unk> <unk> in that matter , were it not for Elijah ’ s otherwise inexplicable question .
But I beat the thing down ; and again <unk> the sleeper , <unk> hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body ; telling him to <unk> himself accordingly .
He put his hand upon the sleeper ’ s rear , as though feeling if it was soft enough ; and then , without more <unk> , sat quietly down there .
“ <unk> !
Queequeg , don ’ t sit there , ” said I.
“ Oh !
<unk> <unk> seat , ” said Queequeg , “ my country way ; won ’ t <unk> him face . ” “ <unk> ! ” said I , “ call that his face ?
very benevolent countenance then ; but how hard he breathes , he ’ s heaving himself ; get off , Queequeg , you are heavy , it ’ s <unk> the face of the poor .
<unk> off , Queequeg !
Look , he ’ ll <unk> you off soon .
I wonder he don ’ t wake . ” Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper , and lighted his tomahawk pipe .
I sat at the feet .
We kept the pipe passing over the sleeper , from one to the other .
Meanwhile , upon <unk> him in his broken fashion , Queequeg gave me to understand that , in his land , owing to the absence of <unk> and <unk> of all sorts , the king , <unk> , and great people generally , were in the custom of <unk> some of the lower orders for <unk> ; and to furnish a house <unk> in that respect , you had only to <unk> up eight or ten <unk> fellows , and lay them round in the <unk> and <unk> .
Besides , it was very convenient on an <unk> ; much better than those <unk> which are <unk> into <unk> ; upon occasion , a chief calling his <unk> , and <unk> him to make a <unk> of himself under a <unk> tree , perhaps in some damp <unk> place .
While <unk> these things , every time Queequeg received the tomahawk from me , he <unk> the <unk> of it over the sleeper ’ s head .
“ What ’ s that for , Queequeg ? ” “ <unk> easy , kill-e ; oh !
<unk> easy ! ” He was going on with some wild <unk> about his <unk> , which , it seemed , had in its two uses both <unk> his foes and <unk> his soul , when we were directly attracted to the sleeping <unk> .
The strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole , it began to tell upon him .
He <unk> with a sort of <unk> ; then seemed troubled in the nose ; then revolved over once or twice ; then sat up and <unk> his eyes .
“ <unk> ! ” he <unk> at last , “ who be ye <unk> ? ” “ <unk> men , ” answered I , “ when does she sail ? ” “ Aye , aye , ye are going in her , be ye ?
She sails to-day .
The Captain came aboard last night . ” “ What Captain ? — Ahab ? ” “ Who but him indeed ? ” I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab , when we heard a noise on deck .
“ <unk> !
Starbuck ’ s <unk> , ” said the <unk> .
“ He ’ s a lively chief mate , that ; good man , and a pious ; but all alive now , I must turn to . ” And so saying he went on deck , and we followed .
It was now clear sunrise .
Soon the crew came on board in <unk> and <unk> ; the <unk> <unk> themselves ; the mates were <unk> engaged ; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board .
Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained <unk> <unk> within his cabin .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> Christmas .
At length , towards noon , upon the final <unk> of the ship ’ s <unk> , and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf , and after the <unk> Charity had come off in a whale-boat , with her last <unk> — a <unk> for Stubb , the second mate , her <unk> , and a spare Bible for the steward — after all this , the two Captains , Peleg and Bildad , issued from the cabin , and turning to the chief mate , Peleg said : “ Now , Mr. Starbuck , are you sure everything is right ?
Captain Ahab is all ready — just spoke to him — nothing more to be got from shore , eh ?
Well , call all hands , then .
<unk> ’ em aft here — blast ’ em ! ” “ No need of profane words , however great the hurry , Peleg , ” said Bildad , “ but away with thee , friend Starbuck , and do our bidding . ” How now !
Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage , Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter-deck , just as if they were to be <unk> at sea , as well as to all appearances in port .
And , as for Captain Ahab , no sign of him was yet to be seen ; only , they said he was in the cabin .
But then , the idea was , that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh , and steering her well out to sea .
Indeed , as that was not at all his proper business , but the pilot ’ s ; and as he was not yet completely recovered — so they said — therefore , Captain Ahab stayed below .
And all this seemed natural enough ; especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor , but remain over the cabin table , having a <unk> <unk> with their shore friends , before they quit the ship for good with the pilot .
But there was not much chance to think over the matter , for Captain Peleg was now all alive .
He seemed to do most of the talking and commanding , and not Bildad .
“ <unk> here , ye sons of <unk> , ” he cried , as the sailors lingered at the main-mast .
“ Mr.
Starbuck , drive ’ em aft . ” “ Strike the tent there ! ” — was the next order .
As I hinted before , this whalebone <unk> was never pitched except in port ; and on board the Pequod , for thirty years , the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor .
“ Man the capstan !
<unk> and thunder ! — jump ! ” — was the next command , and the crew sprang for the handspikes .
Now in getting under weigh , the <unk> generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship .
And here Bildad , who , with Peleg , be it known , in <unk> to his other officers , was one of the <unk> <unk> of the port — he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket <unk> to all the ships he was concerned in , for he never <unk> any other craft — Bildad , I say , might now be seen <unk> engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor , and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of <unk> , to cheer the hands at the windlass , who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in <unk> <unk> , with hearty good will .
Nevertheless , not three days previous , Bildad had told them that no profane <unk> would be allowed on board the Pequod , particularly in getting under weigh ; and Charity , his sister , had placed a small choice copy of <unk> in each seaman ’ s berth .
Meantime , <unk> the other part of the ship , Captain Peleg <unk> and swore astern in the most <unk> manner .
I almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up ; involuntarily I paused on my <unk> , and told Queequeg to do the same , thinking of the perils we both ran , in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot .
I was <unk> myself , however , with the thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation , spite of his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay ; when I felt a sudden sharp <unk> in my rear , and turning round , was <unk> at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity .
That was my first kick .
“ Is that the way they heave in the marchant service ? ” he roared .
“ Spring , thou <unk> ; spring , and break thy <unk> !
Why don ’ t ye spring , I say , all of ye — spring !
Quohog !
spring , thou chap with the red whiskers ; spring there , <unk> ; spring , thou green <unk> .
Spring , I say , all of ye , and spring your eyes out ! ” And so saying , he moved along the windlass , here and there using his leg very freely , while <unk> Bildad kept leading off with his <unk> .
Thinks I , Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day .
At last the anchor was up , the sails were set , and off we glided .
It was a short , cold Christmas ; and as the short northern day <unk> into night , we found ourselves almost broad upon the <unk> ocean , whose <unk> spray <unk> us in ice , as in polished <unk> .
The long rows of teeth on the bulwarks <unk> in the moonlight ; and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant , vast <unk> <unk> <unk> from the bows .
<unk> Bildad , as pilot , headed the first watch , and ever and anon , as the old craft deep dived into the green seas , and sent the shivering frost all over her , and the winds howled , and the <unk> <unk> , his steady <unk> were heard , — _ “ <unk> fields beyond the <unk> flood , Stand dressed in living green .
So to the <unk> old <unk> stood , While <unk> rolled between . ” _ Never did those sweet words sound more <unk> to me than then .
They were full of hope and <unk> .
<unk> of this <unk> winter night in the <unk> Atlantic , spite of my wet feet and <unk> jacket , there was yet , it then seemed to me , many a pleasant haven in store ; and <unk> and <unk> so eternally <unk> , that the grass shot up by the spring , <unk> , <unk> , remains at <unk> .
At last we gained such an offing , that the two <unk> were needed no longer .
The stout <unk> that had accompanied us began ranging alongside .
It was curious and not <unk> , how Peleg and Bildad were affected at this juncture , especially Captain Bildad .
For loath to depart , yet ; very loath to leave , for good , a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage — beyond both <unk> <unk> ; a ship in which some thousands of his hard <unk> dollars were invested ; a ship , in which an old shipmate sailed as captain ; a man almost as old as he , once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the <unk> jaw ; loath to say good-bye to a thing so every way <unk> of every interest to him , — poor old Bildad lingered long ; paced the deck with anxious <unk> ; ran down into the cabin to speak another <unk> word there ; again came on deck , and looked to windward ; looked towards the wide and endless waters , only <unk> by the <unk> unseen <unk> <unk> ; looked towards the land ; looked aloft ; looked right and left ; looked everywhere and nowhere ; and at last , mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin , <unk> grasped stout Peleg by the hand , and holding up a lantern , for a moment stood gazing <unk> in his face , as much as to say , “ Nevertheless , friend Peleg , I can stand it ; yes , I can . ” As for Peleg himself , he took it more like a philosopher ; but for all his philosophy , there was a tear <unk> in his eye , when the lantern came too near .
And he , too , did not a little run from cabin to deck — now a word below , and now a word with Starbuck , the chief mate .
But , at last , he turned to his comrade , with a final sort of look about him , — “ Captain Bildad — come , old shipmate , we must go .
Back the <unk> there !
Boat ahoy !
Stand by to come close alongside , now !
<unk> , careful ! — come , Bildad , boy — say your last .
<unk> to ye , Starbuck — luck to ye , Mr. Stubb — luck to ye , Mr. Flask — good-bye and good luck to ye all — and this day three years I ’ ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket .
Hurrah and away ! ” “ God bless ye , and have ye in His holy keeping , men , ” murmured old Bildad , almost <unk> .
“ I hope ye ’ ll have fine weather now , so that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye — a pleasant sun is all he needs , and ye ’ ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go .
Be careful in the hunt , ye mates .
Don ’ t stave the boats <unk> , ye harpooneers ; good white cedar plank is raised full three <unk> <unk> .
within the year .
Don ’ t forget your prayers , either .
Mr. Starbuck , mind that cooper don ’ t <unk> the spare <unk> .
Oh !
the <unk> are in the green locker !
Don ’ t whale it too much a ’ Lord ’ s days , men ; but don ’ t <unk> a fair chance either , that ’ s <unk> Heaven ’ s good <unk> .
Have an eye to the <unk> tierce , Mr. Stubb ; it was a little leaky , I thought .
If ye touch at the islands , Mr. Flask , beware of <unk> .
Good-bye , good-bye !
Don ’ t keep that cheese too long down in the hold , Mr. Starbuck ; it ’ ll spoil .
Be careful with the butter — twenty <unk> the pound it was , and mind ye , if — ” “ Come , come , Captain Bildad ; stop <unk> , — away ! ” and with that , Peleg hurried him over the side , and both <unk> into the boat .
Ship and boat <unk> ; the cold , damp night breeze blew between ; a screaming <unk> flew overhead ; the two hulls wildly rolled ; we gave three <unk> cheers , and blindly plunged like fate into the lone Atlantic .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> .
Some chapters back , one Bulkington was spoken of , a tall , <unk> mariner , encountered in New Bedford at the inn .
When on that shivering winter ’ s night , the Pequod thrust her <unk> bows into the cold malicious waves , who should I see standing at her helm but Bulkington !
I looked with <unk> awe and <unk> upon the man , who in <unk> just landed from a four years ’ dangerous voyage , could so <unk> push off again for still another tempestuous term .
The land seemed scorching to his feet .
<unk> things are ever the <unk> ; deep memories yield no <unk> ; this <unk> chapter is the <unk> grave of Bulkington .
Let me only say that it <unk> with him as with the <unk> ship , that <unk> <unk> along the leeward land .
The port would fain give <unk> ; the port is <unk> ; in the port is safety , comfort , <unk> , supper , warm <unk> , friends , all that ’ s kind to our <unk> .
But in that gale , the port , the land , is that ship ’ s <unk> jeopardy ; she must fly all <unk> ; one touch of land , though it but <unk> the keel , would make her shudder through and through .
With all her might she crowds all sail off shore ; in so doing , <unk> ’ <unk> the very winds that fain would blow her homeward ; seeks all the lashed sea ’ s <unk> again ; for refuge ’ s sake <unk> rushing into peril ; her only friend her bitterest foe !
<unk> ye now , Bulkington ?
<unk> do ye seem to see of that <unk> intolerable truth ; that all deep , earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open <unk> of her sea ; while the <unk> winds of heaven and earth <unk> to cast her on the treacherous , <unk> shore ?
But as in <unk> alone <unk> highest truth , <unk> , indefinite as God — so , better is it to <unk> in that howling infinite , than be <unk> dashed upon the lee , even if that were safety !
For <unk> , then , oh !
who would craven crawl to land !
<unk> of the terrible !
is all this agony so vain ?
Take heart , take heart , O Bulkington !
Bear thee grimly , <unk> !
Up from the spray of thy <unk> — straight up , leaps thy <unk> !
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
As Queequeg and I are now fairly <unk> in this business of whaling ; and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather <unk> and <unk> pursuit ; therefore , I am all <unk> to <unk> ye , ye landsmen , of the <unk> hereby done to us hunters of whales .
In the first place , it may be deemed almost <unk> to <unk> the fact , that among people at large , the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the <unk> <unk> .
If a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous <unk> society , it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his <unk> , were he presented to the company as a harpooneer , say ; and if in <unk> of the <unk> officers he should <unk> the <unk> <unk>
( Sperm Whale Fishery ) to his <unk> <unk> , such a procedure would be deemed <unk> <unk> and ridiculous .
<unk> one leading reason why the world <unk> <unk> us whalemen , is this : they think that , at best , our vocation <unk> to a <unk> sort of business ; and that when <unk> engaged therein , we are surrounded by all manner of <unk> .
<unk> we are , that is true .
But <unk> , also , and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> have been all <unk> <unk> whom the world invariably <unk> to honor .
And as for the matter of the alleged <unk> of our business , ye shall soon be <unk> into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown , and which , upon the whole , will <unk> <unk> the sperm whale-ship at least among the <unk> things of this <unk> earth .
But even <unk> the charge in question to be true ; what disordered slippery decks of a whale-ship are <unk> to the unspeakable <unk> of those <unk> from which so many <unk> return to drink in all ladies ’ <unk> ?
And if the idea of peril so much <unk> the popular conceit of the <unk> ’ s profession ; let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely <unk> up to a <unk> , would quickly <unk> at the apparition of the sperm whale ’ s vast tail , <unk> into <unk> the air over his head .
For what are the <unk> terrors of man compared with the <unk> terrors and wonders of God !
But , though the world <unk> at us whale hunters , yet does it <unk> pay us the profoundest homage ; yea , an <unk> <unk> !
for almost all the tapers , lamps , and candles that burn round the globe , burn , as before so many <unk> , to our glory !
But look at this matter in other lights ; weigh it in all sorts of scales ; see what we whalemen are , and have been .
Why did the Dutch in De <unk> ’ s time have <unk> of their whaling <unk> ?
Why did Louis <unk> .
of France , at his own personal expense , fit out whaling ships from <unk> , and politely <unk> to that town some score or two of <unk> from our own island of Nantucket ?
Why did <unk> between the years <unk> and <unk> pay to her whalemen in <unk> upwards of £ <unk> ?
And <unk> , how comes it that we whalemen of America now <unk> all the rest of the <unk> whalemen in the world ; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels ; manned by eighteen thousand men ; <unk> <unk> <unk> of dollars ; the ships worth , at the time of sailing , $ <unk> !
and every year <unk> into our harbors a well <unk> <unk> of $ <unk> .
How comes all this , if there be not something <unk> in whaling ?
But this is not the half ; look again .
I freely assert , that the <unk> philosopher cannot , for his life , point out one single peaceful influence , which within the last sixty years has operated more <unk> upon the whole broad world , taken in one <unk> , than the high and mighty business of whaling .
One way and another , it has <unk> events so remarkable in themselves , and so <unk> momentous in their <unk> <unk> , that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother , who bore <unk> themselves <unk> from her <unk> .
It would be a hopeless , endless task to <unk> all these things .
Let a handful <unk> .
For many years past the whale-ship has been the <unk> in <unk> out the remotest and least known parts of the earth .
She has <unk> seas and archipelagoes which had no chart , where no Cook or <unk> had ever sailed .
If American and <unk> <unk> now <unk> <unk> in once savage harbors , let them fire <unk> to the honor and glory of the whale-ship , which originally showed them the way , and first <unk> between them and the savages .
They may <unk> as they will the heroes of <unk> <unk> , your <unk> , your <unk> ; but I say that scores of <unk> Captains have sailed out of Nantucket , that were as great , and greater than your Cook and your <unk> .
For in their <unk> <unk> , they , in the heathenish <unk> waters , and by the <unk> of unrecorded , <unk> islands , <unk> with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his <unk> and muskets would not willingly have dared .
All that is made such a <unk> of in the old South Sea Voyages , those things were but the <unk> <unk> of our <unk> Nantucketers .
Often , adventures which <unk> <unk> three chapters to , these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship ’ s common log .
Ah , the world !
Oh , the world !
<unk> the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn , no commerce but <unk> , scarcely any <unk> but <unk> , was carried on between Europe and the long line of the <unk> Spanish <unk> on the Pacific coast .
It was the whaleman who first broke through the <unk> policy of the Spanish crown , touching those <unk> ; and , if space permitted , it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last <unk> the <unk> of Peru , <unk> , and <unk> from the <unk> of Old Spain , and the <unk> of the eternal <unk> in those parts .
That great America on the other side of the <unk> , <unk> , was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman .
After its first <unk> discovery by a <unk> , all other ships long <unk> those shores as <unk> <unk> ; but the whale-ship touched there .
The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty <unk> .
Moreover , in the infancy of the first <unk> <unk> , the <unk> were several times saved from <unk> by the benevolent biscuit of the whale-ship <unk> dropping an anchor in their waters .
The <unk> isles of all <unk> confess the same truth , and do <unk> homage to the whale-ship , that cleared the way for the <unk> and the merchant , and in many cases carried the <unk> <unk> to their first <unk> .
If that <unk> land , Japan , is ever to become hospitable , it is the whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due ; for already she is on the threshold .
But if , in the face of all this , you still declare that whaling has no <unk> noble associations connected with it , then am I ready to shiver fifty lances with you there , and <unk> you with a split <unk> every time .
The whale has no famous author , and whaling no famous <unk> , you will say .
_ The whale no famous author , and whaling no famous <unk> ? _ Who <unk> the first account of our Leviathan ?
Who but mighty Job !
And who <unk> the first narrative of a <unk> ?
Who , but no less a <unk> than <unk> the Great , who , with his own royal pen , took down the words from Other , the <unk> whale-hunter of those times !
And who pronounced our glowing <unk> in <unk> ?
Who , but <unk> <unk> !
True enough , but then whalemen themselves are poor devils ; they have no good blood in their veins .
_ No good blood in their veins ? _ They have something better than royal blood there .
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> was Mary <unk> ; afterwards , by <unk> , Mary <unk> , one of the old <unk> of Nantucket , and the <unk> to a long line of <unk> and harpooneers — all <unk> and <unk> to noble <unk> — this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other .
Good again ; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not <unk> .
_ Whaling not <unk> ? _ Whaling is imperial !
By old English <unk> law , the whale is declared “ a royal fish . ” * Oh , that ’ s only <unk> !
The whale himself has never <unk> in any grand imposing way .
_ The whale never <unk> in any grand imposing way ? _ In one of the mighty <unk> given to a Roman general upon his entering the world ’ s <unk> , the bones of a whale , brought all the way from the <unk> coast , were the most conspicuous object in the <unk> <unk> .
* * See subsequent chapters for something more on this head .
<unk> it , since you <unk> it ; but , say what you will , there is no real dignity in whaling .
_ No dignity in whaling ? _ The dignity of our calling the very heavens <unk> .

No more !

No more !
I know a man that , in his lifetime , has taken three hundred and fifty whales .
I account that man more honorable than that great captain of antiquity who <unk> of taking as many <unk> towns .
And , as for me , if , by any possibility , there be any as yet <unk> prime thing in me ; if I shall ever <unk> any real <unk> in that small but high <unk> world which I might not be <unk> <unk> of ; if hereafter I shall do anything that , upon the whole , a man might rather have done than to have left <unk> ; if , at my death , my <unk> , or more properly my <unk> , find any precious <unk> .
in my desk , then here I <unk> ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling ; for a whale-ship was my <unk> <unk> and my <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> .
In <unk> of the dignity of whaling , I would fain advance naught but <unk> facts .
But after <unk> his facts , an <unk> who should wholly <unk> a not <unk> <unk> , which might tell <unk> upon his cause — such an <unk> , would he not be <unk> ?
It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens , even modern ones , a certain curious process of <unk> them for their <unk> is gone through .
There is a <unk> of state , so called , and there may be a <unk> of state .
How they use the salt , precisely — who knows ?
<unk> I am , however , that a king ’ s head is solemnly <unk> at his coronation , even as a head of <unk> .
Can it be , though , that they <unk> it with a view of making its interior run well , as they <unk> <unk> ?
Much might be <unk> here , concerning the <unk> dignity of this regal process , because in common life we <unk> but <unk> and <unk> a fellow who <unk> his hair , and <unk> smells of that <unk> .
In truth , a <unk> man who uses <unk> , unless <unk> , that man has probably got a <unk> spot in him somewhere .
As a general rule , he can ’ t amount to much in his <unk> .
But the only thing to be considered here , is this — what kind of oil is used at <unk> ?
<unk> it cannot be <unk> oil , nor <unk> oil , nor <unk> oil , nor bear ’ s oil , nor train oil , nor <unk> oil .
What then can it possibly be , but sperm oil in its <unk> , <unk> state , the <unk> of all <unk> ?
Think of that , ye <unk> <unk> !
we whalemen supply your kings and queens with coronation stuff !
CHAPTER <unk> .
Knights and Squires .
The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck , a native of Nantucket , and a Quaker by <unk> .
He was a long , earnest man , and though born on an icy coast , seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes , his flesh being hard as <unk> biscuit .
<unk> to the <unk> , his live blood would not spoil like <unk> ale .
He must have been born in some time of general <unk> and <unk> , or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous .
Only some thirty <unk> <unk> had he seen ; those <unk> had dried up all his physical <unk> .
But this , his <unk> , so to speak , seemed no more the token of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , than it seemed the <unk> of any bodily <unk> .
It was merely the <unk> of the man .
He was by no means <unk> ; quite the contrary .
His pure tight skin was an excellent fit ; and closely wrapped up in it , and embalmed with inner health and strength , like a <unk> Egyptian , this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come , and to endure always , as now ; for be it Polar snow or <unk> sun , like a <unk> <unk> , his interior vitality was <unk> to do well in all <unk> .
<unk> into his eyes , you seemed to see there the yet lingering <unk> of those <unk> perils he had calmly <unk> through life .
A <unk> , steadfast man , whose life for the most part was a telling <unk> of action , and not a tame chapter of sounds .
Yet , for all his hardy <unk> and fortitude , there were certain qualities in him which at times affected , and in some cases seemed well nigh to <unk> all the rest .
<unk> conscientious for a seaman , and <unk> with a deep natural reverence , the wild watery <unk> of his life did therefore strongly <unk> him to superstition ; but to that sort of superstition , which in some <unk> seems rather to spring , somehow , from intelligence than from ignorance .
<unk> portents and inward <unk> were his .
And if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul , much more did his <unk> domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child , tend to bend him still more from the original <unk> of his nature , and open him still further to those latent influences which , in some <unk> men , <unk> the gush of <unk> daring , so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery .
“ I will have no man in my boat , ” said Starbuck , “ who is not afraid of a whale . ” By this , he seemed to mean , not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which <unk> from the fair <unk> of the encountered peril , but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward .
“ Aye , aye , ” said Stubb , the second mate , “ Starbuck , there , is as careful a man as you ’ ll find anywhere in this fishery . ” But we shall ere long see what that word “ careful ” precisely means when used by a man like Stubb , or almost any other whale hunter .
Starbuck was no <unk> after perils ; in him courage was not a <unk> ; but a thing simply useful to him , and always at hand upon all <unk> practical occasions .
Besides , he thought , perhaps , that in this business of whaling , courage was one of the great <unk> <unk> of the ship , like her beef and her bread , and not to be <unk> wasted .
Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after <unk> ; nor for <unk> in fighting a fish that too much <unk> in fighting him .
For , thought Starbuck , I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living , and not to be killed by them for theirs ; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew .
What doom was his own father ’ s ?
Where , in the bottomless deeps , could he find the torn limbs of his brother ?
With memories like these in him , and , moreover , given to a certain <unk> , as has been said ; the courage of this Starbuck which could , nevertheless , still <unk> , must indeed have been extreme .
But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so <unk> , and with such terrible experiences and <unk> as he had ; it was not in nature that these things should fail in <unk> <unk> an element in him , which , under <unk> circumstances , would break out from its <unk> , and burn all his courage up .
And brave as he might be , it was that sort of <unk> chiefly , visible in some intrepid men , which , while generally <unk> firm in the <unk> with seas , or winds , or whales , or any of the ordinary <unk> horrors of the world , yet cannot withstand those more terrific , because more spiritual terrors , which sometimes <unk> you from the <unk> brow of an enraged and mighty man .
But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance , the complete <unk> of poor Starbuck ’ s fortitude , scarce might I have the heart to write it ; for it is a thing most <unk> , nay <unk> , to expose the fall of <unk> in the soul .
Men may seem <unk> as <unk> <unk> and nations ; <unk> , <unk> , and murderers there may be ; men may have mean and <unk> faces ; but man , in the <unk> , is so noble and so sparkling , such a grand and glowing creature , that over any <unk> <unk> in him all his fellows should run to throw their <unk> robes .
That <unk> <unk> we feel within ourselves , so far within us , that it remains <unk> though all the outer character seem gone ; <unk> with <unk> anguish at the <unk> spectacle of a <unk> man .
Nor can <unk> itself , at such a <unk> sight , completely <unk> her <unk> against the <unk> stars .
But this <unk> dignity I <unk> of , is not the dignity of kings and robes , but that abounding dignity which has no <unk> <unk> .
Thou <unk> see it <unk> in the arm that <unk> a pick or <unk> a <unk> ; that <unk> dignity which , on all hands , <unk> without end from God ; <unk> !
The great God absolute !
The centre and circumference of all <unk> !
His <unk> , our divine <unk> !
If , then , to meanest mariners , and <unk> and <unk> , I shall hereafter ascribe high qualities , though dark ; <unk> round them tragic <unk> ; if even the most <unk> , <unk> the most <unk> , among them all , shall at times lift himself to the <unk> mounts ; if I shall touch that <unk> ’ s arm with some <unk> light ; if I shall spread a <unk> over his <unk> set of sun ; then against all mortal <unk> bear me out in it , thou just <unk> of <unk> , which hast spread one royal <unk> of <unk> over all my kind !
Bear me out in it , thou great <unk> God !
who didst not refuse to the swart <unk> , <unk> , the pale , <unk> <unk> ; Thou who didst <unk> with <unk> hammered leaves of finest gold , the <unk> and <unk> arm of old <unk> ; Thou who didst pick up <unk> <unk> from the <unk> ; who didst <unk> him upon a <unk> ; who didst thunder him higher than a throne !
Thou who , in all Thy mighty , earthly <unk> , ever <unk> Thy <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> ; bear me out in it , O God !
CHAPTER <unk> .
Knights and Squires .
Stubb was the second mate .
He was a native of Cape Cod ; and hence , according to <unk> usage , was called a <unk> .
A <unk> ; neither craven nor valiant ; taking perils as they came with an indifferent air ; and while engaged in the most imminent <unk> of the chase , toiling away , calm and collected as a <unk> <unk> engaged for the year .
<unk> , easy , and careless , he <unk> over his whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner , and his crew all invited guests .
He was as particular about the comfortable <unk> of his part of the boat , as an old <unk> is about the <unk> of his box .
When close to the whale , in the very <unk> of the fight , he handled his <unk> lance coolly and <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> his hammer .
He would hum over his old <unk> <unk> while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster .
Long usage had , for this Stubb , converted the jaws of death into an easy chair .
What he thought of death itself , there is no telling .
Whether he ever thought of it at all , might be a question ; but , if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner , no doubt , like a good sailor , he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to <unk> aloft , and <unk> themselves there , about something which he would find out when he <unk> the order , and not sooner .
What , perhaps , with other things , made Stubb such an <unk> , <unk> man , so cheerily <unk> off with the burden of life in a world full of grave <unk> , all bowed to the ground with their <unk> ; what helped to bring about that almost impious <unk> of his ; that thing must have been his pipe .
For , like his nose , his short , black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face .
You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his <unk> without his nose as without his pipe .
He kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded , stuck in a rack , within easy reach of his hand ; and , whenever he turned in , he smoked them all out in succession , <unk> one from the other to the end of the chapter ; then <unk> them again to be in readiness anew .
For , when Stubb dressed , instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers , he put his pipe into his mouth .
I say this continual smoking must have been one cause , at least , of his peculiar <unk> ; for every one knows that this earthly air , whether ashore or afloat , is <unk> <unk> with the nameless <unk> of the numberless mortals who have died <unk> it ; and as in time of the <unk> , some people go about with a <unk> handkerchief to their mouths ; so , likewise , against all mortal <unk> , Stubb ’ s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of <unk> agent .
The third mate was Flask , a native of <unk> , in Martha ’ s Vineyard .
A short , stout , <unk> young fellow , very <unk> concerning whales , who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and <unk> <unk> him ; and therefore it was a sort of point of honor with him , to destroy them whenever encountered .
So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways ; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them ; that in his poor opinion , the wondrous whale was but a species of <unk> <unk> , or at least <unk> , <unk> only a little <unk> and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and <unk> .
This ignorant , unconscious <unk> of his made him a little <unk> in the matter of whales ; he followed these fish for the fun of it ; and a three years ’ voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that <unk> that length of time .
As a carpenter ’ s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails ; so mankind may be <unk> divided .
<unk> Flask was one of the wrought ones ; made to <unk> tight and last long .
They called him King-Post on board of the Pequod ; because , in form , he could be well likened to the short , square timber known by that name in Arctic whalers ; and which by the means of many <unk> side timbers inserted into it , <unk> to brace the ship against the icy <unk> of those <unk> seas .
Now these three mates — Starbuck , Stubb , and Flask , were momentous men .
They it was who by universal <unk> commanded three of the Pequod ’ s boats as headsmen .
In that grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably <unk> his <unk> to descend on the whales , these three headsmen were as captains of companies .
Or , being armed with their long keen whaling spears , they were as a picked <unk> of <unk> ; even as the harpooneers were <unk> of <unk> .
And since in this famous fishery , each mate or headsman , like a Gothic <unk> of old , is always accompanied by his <unk> or harpooneer , who in certain <unk> <unk> him with a fresh lance , when the former one has been badly twisted , or <unk> in the assault ; and moreover , as there generally <unk> between the two , a close <unk> and <unk> ; it is therefore but meet , that in this place we set down who the Pequod ’ s harpooneers were , and to what headsman each of them belonged .
First of all was Queequeg , whom Starbuck , the chief mate , had <unk> for his <unk> .
But Queequeg is already known .
Next was Tashtego , an <unk> Indian from <unk> Head , the most <unk> promontory of Martha ’ s Vineyard , where there still exists the last <unk> of a village of red men , which has long supplied the neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers .
In the fishery , they usually go by the generic name of <unk> .
Tashtego ’ s long , lean , sable hair , his high cheek bones , and black rounding eyes — for an Indian , Oriental in their <unk> , but Antarctic in their glittering expression — all this sufficiently <unk> him an <unk> of the <unk> blood of those proud warrior hunters , who , in quest of the great New England <unk> , had <unk> , bow in hand , the aboriginal forests of the main .
But no longer <unk> in the <unk> of the wild beasts of the <unk> , Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea ; the <unk> harpoon of the son <unk> <unk> the infallible <unk> of the <unk> .
To look at the tawny <unk> of his <unk> <unk> limbs , you would almost have <unk> the superstitions of some of the earlier <unk> , and <unk> this wild Indian to be a son of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
Tashtego was Stubb the second mate ’ s <unk> .
Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo , a gigantic , <unk> <unk> , with a <unk> <unk> — an <unk> to behold .
<unk> from his ears were two golden hoops , so large that the sailors called them <unk> , and would talk of securing the <unk> <unk> to them .
In his youth Daggoo had <unk> shipped on board of a whaler , lying in a lonely bay on his native coast .
And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa , Nantucket , and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen ; and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped ; Daggoo retained all his barbaric <unk> , and erect as a <unk> , moved about the decks in all the <unk> of six feet five in his socks .
There was a corporeal <unk> in looking up at him ; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
<unk> to tell , this imperial negro , <unk> Daggoo , was the <unk> of little Flask , who looked like a <unk> beside him .
As for the <unk> of the Pequod ’ s company , be it said , that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the American whale fishery , are Americans born , though pretty nearly all the officers are .
<unk> it is the same with the American whale fishery as with the American <unk> and military and merchant navies , and the <unk> <unk> employed in the <unk> of the American <unk> and <unk> .
The same , I say , because in all these cases the native American <unk> <unk> the brains , the rest of the world as <unk> <unk> the muscles .
No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the <unk> , where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy <unk> of those rocky shores .
In like manner , the Greenland whalers sailing out of <unk> or London , put in at the <unk> Islands , to receive the full <unk> of their crew .
Upon the passage <unk> , they drop them there again .
How it is , there is no telling , but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen .
They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod , _ <unk> _ too , I call such , not <unk> the common continent of men , but each _ <unk> _ living on a separate continent of his own .
Yet now , <unk> along one keel , what a set these <unk> were !
An <unk> <unk> <unk> from all the isles of the sea , and all the ends of the earth , accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world ’ s <unk> before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back .
Black <unk> Pip — he never did — oh , no !
he went before .
Poor Alabama boy !
On the grim Pequod ’ s forecastle , ye shall ere long see him , beating his tambourine ; <unk> of the eternal time , when sent for , to the great quarter-deck on high , he was bid strike in with angels , and beat his tambourine in glory ; called a coward here , hailed a <unk> there !
CHAPTER <unk> .
Ahab .
For several days after leaving Nantucket , nothing above hatches was seen of Captain Ahab .
The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches , and for aught that could be seen to the contrary , they seemed to be the only <unk> of the ship ; only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and <unk> , that after all it was plain they but commanded <unk> .
Yes , their <unk> lord and <unk> was there , though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to <unk> into the now sacred retreat of the cabin .
Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below , I instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible ; for my first vague <unk> touching the unknown captain , now in the <unk> of the sea , became almost a <unk> .
This was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijah ’ s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to me , with a subtle energy I could not have before <unk> of .
But <unk> could I withstand them , much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn <unk> of that outlandish prophet of the wharves .
But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or <unk> — to call it so — which I felt , yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship , it seemed against all <unk> to cherish such emotions .
For though the harpooneers , with the great body of the crew , were a far more barbaric , heathenish , and <unk> set than any of the tame <unk> companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with , still I ascribed this — and <unk> ascribed it — to the fierce <unk> of the very nature of that wild <unk> vocation in which I had so <unk> <unk> .
But it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship , the mates , which was most <unk> calculated to <unk> these <unk> <unk> , and induce confidence and <unk> in every <unk> of the voyage .
Three better , more <unk> <unk> and men , each in his own different way , could not readily be found , and they were every one of them Americans ; a Nantucketer , a <unk> , a Cape man .
Now , it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor , for a space we had biting Polar weather , though all the time running away from it to the <unk> ; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed , gradually leaving that <unk> winter , and all its intolerable weather behind us .
It was one of those less lowering , but still grey and gloomy enough <unk> of the transition , when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a <unk> sort of leaping and melancholy <unk> , that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the <unk> watch , so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail , <unk> <unk> ran over me .
<unk> <unk> apprehension ; Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck .
There seemed no sign of common bodily <unk> about him , nor of the <unk> from any .
He looked like a man cut away from the <unk> , when the fire has <unk> wasted all the limbs without <unk> them , or taking away one <unk> from their <unk> aged <unk> .
His whole high , broad form , seemed made of solid <unk> , and <unk> in an unalterable mould , like <unk> ’ s cast Perseus .
<unk> its way out from among his grey hairs , and <unk> right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck , till it disappeared in his <unk> , you saw a slender <unk> mark , <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> that perpendicular <unk> sometimes made in the straight , lofty trunk of a great tree , when the upper lightning <unk> darts down it , and without <unk> a single <unk> , <unk> and grooves out the <unk> from top to bottom , ere running off into the soil , leaving the tree still <unk> alive , but branded .
Whether that mark was born with him , or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound , no one could certainly say .
By some <unk> <unk> , throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it , especially by the mates .
But once Tashtego ’ s <unk> , an old <unk> Indian among the crew , <unk> <unk> that not till he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded , and then it came upon him , not in the fury of any mortal <unk> , but in an <unk> <unk> at sea .
Yet , this wild hint seemed <unk> <unk> , by what a grey Manxman <unk> , an old <unk> man , who , having never before sailed out of Nantucket , had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab .
Nevertheless , the old <unk> , the immemorial <unk> , popularly invested this old Manxman with preternatural powers of <unk> .
So that no white sailor <unk> <unk> him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out — which might hardly come to pass , so he muttered — then , whoever should do that last office for the dead , would find a <unk> on him from crown to sole .
So <unk> did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me , and the <unk> <unk> which <unk> it , that for the first few moments I hardly <unk> that not a little of this overbearing <unk> was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood .
It had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale ’ s jaw .
“ Aye , he was dismasted off Japan , ” said the old <unk> Indian once ; “ but like his dismasted craft , he shipped another mast without coming home for it .
He has a <unk> of ’ em . ” I was struck with the singular posture he maintained .
Upon each side of the Pequod ’ s quarter deck , and pretty close to the <unk> shrouds , there was an <unk> hole , <unk> about half an inch or so , into the plank .
His bone leg <unk> in that hole ; one arm elevated , and holding by a shroud ; Captain Ahab stood erect , looking straight out beyond the ship ’ s <unk> prow .
There was an <unk> of <unk> fortitude , a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in the fixed and fearless , forward <unk> of that glance .
Not a word he spoke ; nor did his officers say aught to him ; though by all their <unk> gestures and <unk> , they plainly showed the <unk> , if not <unk> , consciousness of being under a troubled <unk> .
And not only that , but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a <unk> in his face ; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe .
Ere long , from his first visit in the air , he <unk> into his cabin .
But after that morning , he was every day visible to the crew ; either standing in his pivot-hole , or seated upon an ivory <unk> he had ; or heavily walking the deck .
As the sky grew less gloomy ; indeed , began to grow a little genial , he became still less and less a <unk> ; as if , when the ship had sailed from home , nothing but the dead <unk> <unk> of the sea had then kept him so <unk> .
And , by and by , it came to pass , that he was almost continually in the air ; but , as yet , for all that he said , or <unk> did , on the at last sunny deck , he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast .
But the Pequod was only making a passage now ; not regularly cruising ; nearly all whaling <unk> <unk> <unk> the mates were fully competent to , so that there was little or nothing , out of himself , to <unk> or <unk> Ahab , now ; and thus chase away , for that one interval , the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow , as ever all clouds choose the <unk> <unk> to pile themselves upon .
Nevertheless , ere long , the warm , <unk> <unk> of the pleasant , <unk> weather we came to , seemed gradually to charm him from his mood .
For , as when the <unk> , dancing girls , <unk> and May , <unk> home to the <unk> , <unk> woods ; even the <unk> , <unk> , most <unk> old oak will at least send forth some few green <unk> , to welcome such <unk> <unk> ; so Ahab did , in the end , a little <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of that <unk> air .
More than once did he put forth the faint <unk> of a look , which , in any other man , would have soon <unk> out in a smile .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> Ahab ; to Him , Stubb .
Some days elapsed , and ice and <unk> all astern , the Pequod now went rolling through the bright <unk> spring , which , at sea , almost <unk> <unk> on the threshold of the eternal August of the <unk> .
The <unk> cool , clear , ringing , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> days , were as crystal <unk> of Persian <unk> , <unk> up — <unk> up , with <unk> snow .
The <unk> and stately nights seemed haughty <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> at home in lonely pride , the memory of their absent <unk> <unk> , the golden <unk> <unk> !
For sleeping man , ’ <unk> hard to choose between such <unk> days and such <unk> nights .
But all the <unk> of that <unk> weather did not merely <unk> new <unk> and <unk> to the outward world .
<unk> they turned upon the soul , especially when the still mild hours of eve came on ; then , memory shot her <unk> as the clear ice most forms of noiseless <unk> .
And all these subtle agencies , more and more they wrought on Ahab ’ s <unk> .
Old age is always <unk> ; as if , the longer linked with life , the less man has to do with aught that looks like death .
Among <unk> , the old <unk> will <unk> leave their <unk> to visit the <unk> deck .
It was so with Ahab ; only that now , of late , he seemed so much to live in the open air , that truly speaking , his visits were more to the cabin , than from the cabin to the planks .
“ It feels like going down into one ’ s tomb , ” — he would <unk> to himself — “ for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle , to go to my <unk> berth . ” So , almost every <unk> hours , when the watches of the night were set , and the band on deck <unk> the <unk> of the band below ; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle , the sailors flung it not <unk> down , as by day , but with some <unk> <unk> it to its place for fear of <unk> their <unk> shipmates ; when this sort of steady quietude would begin to <unk> , <unk> , the silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle ; and ere long the old man would <unk> , <unk> at the iron <unk> , to help his <unk> way .
Some considering touch of <unk> was in him ; for at times like these , he usually <unk> from <unk> the quarter-deck ; because to his <unk> mates , seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel , such would have been the <unk> crack and din of that bony step , that their dreams would have been on the <unk> teeth of sharks .
But once , the mood was on him too deep for common <unk> ; and as with heavy , <unk> pace he was <unk> the ship from taffrail to mainmast , Stubb , the old second mate , came up from below , with a certain <unk> , <unk> <unk> , hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks , then , no one could say nay ; but there might be some way of <unk> the noise ; <unk> something <unk> and <unk> about a globe of tow , and the <unk> into it , of the ivory heel .
Ah !
Stubb , thou didst not know Ahab then .
“ <unk> I a <unk> , Stubb , ” said Ahab , “ that thou <unk> wad me that fashion ?
But go thy ways ; I had <unk> .
<unk> to thy <unk> grave ; where such as ye sleep between shrouds , to use ye to the filling one at last . — Down , dog , and <unk> ! ” <unk> at the <unk> concluding exclamation of the so suddenly <unk> old man , Stubb was speechless a moment ; then said <unk> , “ I am not used to be spoken to that way , sir ; I do but less than half like it , sir . ” “ Avast !
<unk> Ahab between his set teeth , and violently moving away , as if to avoid some <unk> <unk> .
“ No , sir ; not yet , ” said Stubb , <unk> , “ I will not <unk> be called a dog , sir . ” “ Then be called ten times a <unk> , and a <unk> , and an <unk> , and <unk> , or I ’ ll clear the world of thee ! ” As he said this , Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspect , that Stubb involuntarily retreated .
“ I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it , ” muttered Stubb , as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle .
“ It ’ s very queer .
Stop , Stubb ; somehow , now , I don ’ t well know whether to go back and strike him , or — what ’ s that ? — down here on my knees and pray for him ?
Yes , that was the thought coming up in me ; but it would be the first time I ever _ did _ pray .
It ’ s queer ; very queer ; and he ’ s queer too ; aye , take him fore and aft , he ’ s about the <unk> old man Stubb ever sailed with .
How he <unk> at me ! — his eyes like <unk> !
is he mad ?
<unk> there ’ s something on his mind , as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks .
He <unk> in his bed now , either , more than three hours out of the <unk> ; and he don ’ t sleep then .
Didn ’ t that Dough-Boy , the steward , tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man ’ s hammock clothes all <unk> and tumbled , and the sheets down at the foot , and the <unk> almost tied into <unk> , and the pillow a sort of <unk> hot , as though a <unk> <unk> had been on it ?
A hot old man !
I guess he ’ s got what some <unk> ashore call a conscience ; it ’ s a kind of <unk> they say — worse nor a <unk> .
Well , well ; I don ’ t know what it is , but the Lord keep me from catching it .
He ’ s full of <unk> ; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for , every night , as Dough-Boy tells me he <unk> ; what ’ s that for , I should like to know ?
Who ’ s made <unk> with him in the hold ?
<unk> ’ t that queer , now ?
But there ’ s no telling , it ’ s the old game — Here goes for a <unk> .
Damn me , it ’ s worth a fellow ’ s while to be born into the world , if only to fall right asleep .
And now that I think of it , that ’ s about the first thing <unk> do , and that ’ s a sort of queer , too .
Damn me , but all things are queer , come to think of ’ em .
But that ’ s against my principles .
Think not , is my <unk> <unk> ; and sleep when you can , is my <unk> — So here goes again .
But how ’ s that ?
didn ’ t he call me a dog ?
<unk> !
he called me ten times a <unk> , and piled a lot of <unk> on top of _ that ! _ He might as well have kicked me , and done with it .
<unk> he _ did _ kick me , and I didn ’ t observe it , I was so taken all <unk> with his brow , somehow .
It <unk> like a <unk> bone .
What the devil ’ s the matter with me ?
I don ’ t stand right on my legs .
Coming <unk> of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out .
By the Lord , I must have been dreaming , though — How ?
how ?
how ? — but the only way ’ s to <unk> it ; so here goes to hammock again ; and in the morning , I ’ ll see how this <unk> <unk> thinks over by daylight . ” CHAPTER 30 .
The <unk> .
When Stubb had departed , Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks ; and then , as had been usual with him of late , calling a sailor of the watch , he sent him below for his ivory <unk> , and also his pipe .
<unk> the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the <unk> on the weather side of the deck , he sat and smoked .
In old <unk> times , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> kings were <unk> , saith <unk> , of the tusks of the <unk> .
How could one look at Ahab then , seated on that <unk> of bones , without bethinking him of the royalty it <unk> ?
For a <unk> of the plank , and a king of the sea , and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab .
Some moments passed , during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs , which blew back again into his face .
“ How now , ” he soliloquized at last , withdrawing the tube , “ this smoking no longer <unk> .
Oh , my pipe !
hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone !
Here have I been unconsciously toiling , not <unk> — aye , and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while ; to windward , and with such nervous <unk> , as if , like the dying whale , my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble .
What business have I with this pipe ?
This thing that is meant for <unk> , to send up mild white vapors among mild white hairs , not among torn <unk> <unk> like mine .
I ’ ll smoke no more — ” He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea .
The fire hissed in the waves ; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made .
With slouched hat , Ahab <unk> paced the planks .
CHAPTER <unk> .
Queen <unk> .
Next morning Stubb accosted Flask .
“ Such a queer dream , King-Post , I never had .
You know the old man ’ s ivory leg , well I <unk> he kicked me with it ; and when I tried to kick back , upon my soul , my little man , I kicked my leg right off !
And then , <unk> !
Ahab seemed a pyramid , and I , like a blazing fool , kept kicking at it .
But what was still more curious , Flask — you know how curious all dreams are — through all this rage that I was in , I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself , that after all , it was not much of an insult , that kick from Ahab .
‘ Why , ’ thinks I , ‘ what ’ s the row ?
It ’ s not a real leg , only a false leg . ’ And there ’ s a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump .
That ’ s what makes a blow from the hand , Flask , fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane .
The living member — that makes the living insult , my little man .
And thinks I to myself all the while , mind , while I was <unk> my silly toes against that cursed pyramid — so <unk> <unk> was it all , all the while , I say , I was thinking to myself , ‘ what ’ s his leg now , but a cane — a whalebone cane .
Yes , ’ thinks I , ‘ it was only a <unk> <unk> — in fact , only a <unk> that he gave me — not a base kick .
Besides , ’ thinks I , ‘ look at it once ; why , the end of it — the foot part — what a small sort of end it is ; whereas , if a broad <unk> <unk> kicked me , _ there ’ s _ a devilish broad insult .
But this insult is <unk> down to a point only . ’ But now comes the greatest joke of the dream , Flask .
While I was <unk> away at the pyramid , a sort of <unk> old <unk> , with a hump on his back , takes me by the shoulders , and <unk> me round .
‘ What are you ’ <unk> ? ’ says he .
<unk> !
man , but I was frightened .
Such a <unk> !
But , somehow , next moment I was over the fright .
‘ What am I about ? ’ says I at last .
‘ And what business is that of yours , I should like to know , Mr. <unk> ?
Do _ you _ want a kick ? ’ By the lord , Flask , I had no sooner said that , than he turned round his stern to me , bent over , and dragging up a lot of <unk> he had for a <unk> — what do you think , I saw ? — why thunder alive , man , his stern was stuck full of <unk> , with the points out .
<unk> I , on second thoughts , ‘ I guess I won ’ t kick you , old fellow . ’ ‘ <unk> Stubb , ’ said he , ‘ wise Stubb ; ’ and kept muttering it all the time , a sort of eating of his own <unk> like a chimney <unk> .
Seeing he wasn ’ t going to stop saying over his ‘ wise Stubb , wise Stubb , ’ I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again .
But I had only just lifted my foot for it , when he roared out , ‘ Stop that kicking ! ’ ‘ Halloa , ’ says I , ‘ what ’ s the matter now , old fellow ? ’ ‘ Look ye here , ’ says he ; ‘ let ’ s <unk> the insult .
Captain Ahab kicked ye , didn ’ t he ? ’ ‘ Yes , he did , ’ says I — ‘ right _ here _ it was . ’ ‘ Very good , ’ says he — ‘ he used his ivory leg , didn ’ t he ? ’ ‘ Yes , he did , ’ says I.
‘ Well then , ’ says he , ‘ wise Stubb , what have you to <unk> of ?
Didn ’ t he kick with right good will ?
it wasn ’ t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with , was it ?
No , you were kicked by a great man , and with a beautiful ivory leg , Stubb .
It ’ s an honor ; I consider it an honor .
<unk> , wise Stubb .
In old England the greatest <unk> think it great glory to be <unk> by a <unk> , and made <unk> of ; but , be _ your _ <unk> , Stubb , that ye were kicked by old Ahab , and made a wise man of .
<unk> what I say ; _ be _ kicked by him ; account his <unk> <unk> ; and on no account kick back ; for you can ’ t help yourself , wise Stubb .
Don ’ t you see that pyramid ? ’ With that , he all of a sudden seemed somehow , in some queer fashion , to swim off into the air .
I <unk> ; rolled over ; and there I was in my hammock !
Now , what do you think of that dream , Flask ? ” “ I don ’ t know ; it seems a sort of foolish to me , <unk> . ’ ” “ May be ; may be .
But it ’ s made a wise man of me , Flask .
D ’ ye see Ahab standing there , sideways looking over the stern ?
Well , the best thing you can do , Flask , is to let the old man alone ; never speak to him , whatever he says .
Halloa !
What ’ s that he <unk> ?
Hark ! ” “ <unk> , there !
Look sharp , all of ye !
There are whales hereabouts !
“ If ye see a white one , split your lungs for him !
“ What do you think of that now , Flask ?
ain ’ t there a small drop of something queer about that , eh ?
A white whale — did ye mark that , man ?
Look ye — there ’ s something special in the wind .
Stand by for it , Flask .
Ahab has that that ’ s bloody on his mind .
But , <unk> ; he comes this way . ” CHAPTER <unk> .
Cetology .
Already we are boldly launched upon the deep ; but soon we shall be lost in its <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Ere that come to pass ; ere the Pequod ’ s <unk> hull rolls side by side with the <unk> hulls of the leviathan ; at the <unk> it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a <unk> <unk> understanding of the more special leviathanic <unk> and allusions of all sorts which are to follow .
It is some <unk> <unk> of the whale in his broad <unk> , that I would now fain put before you .
Yet is it no easy task .
The classification of the <unk> of a chaos , nothing less is here <unk> .
<unk> to what the best and <unk> authorities have laid down .
“ No branch of <unk> is so much involved as that which is entitled Cetology , ” says Captain Scoresby , A.D. <unk> .
“ It is not my intention , were it in my power , to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the <unk> into <unk> and <unk> .
* * * <unk> <unk> exists among the <unk> of this animal ” ( sperm whale ) , says <unk> Beale , A.D. <unk> .
“ <unk> to <unk> our research in the <unk> waters . ” “ <unk> veil covering our knowledge of the <unk> . ” “ A field <unk> with <unk> . ” “ All these <unk> <unk> but serve to <unk> us naturalists . ” Thus speak of the whale , the great Cuvier , and John Hunter , and <unk> , those lights of <unk> and anatomy .
Nevertheless , though of real knowledge there be little , yet of books there are a plenty ; and so in some small degree , with cetology , or the science of whales .
Many are the men , small and great , old and new , landsmen and seamen , who have at large or in little , written of the whale .
<unk> over a few : — The <unk> of the Bible ; <unk> ; Pliny ; <unk> ; Sir Thomas Browne ; <unk> ; <unk> ; Linnæus ; <unk> ; <unk> ; Green ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; Baron Cuvier ; Frederick Cuvier ; John Hunter ; Owen ; Scoresby ; Beale ; Bennett ; <unk> <unk> Browne ; the <unk> of <unk> Coffin ; <unk> ; and the <unk>
T. <unk> .
But to what ultimate <unk> purpose all these have written , the above <unk> extracts will show .
Of the names in this list of whale <unk> , only those following Owen ever saw living whales ; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman .
I mean Captain Scoresby .
On the separate subject of the Greenland or <unk> , he is the best <unk> authority .
But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale , compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy <unk> .
And here be it said , that the Greenland whale is an <unk> upon the throne of the seas .
He is not even by any means the largest of the whales .
Yet , owing to the long <unk> of his <unk> , and the profound ignorance which , till some seventy years back , invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown <unk> , and which ignorance to this present day still <unk> in all but some few scientific <unk> and <unk> ; this <unk> has been every way complete .
<unk> to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great <unk> of past days , will <unk> you that the Greenland whale , without one <unk> , was to them the <unk> of the seas .
But the time has at last come for a new <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> ; hear ye !
good people all , — the Greenland whale is <unk> , — the great sperm whale now <unk> !
There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you , and at the same time , in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt .
Those books are Beale ’ s and Bennett ’ s ; both in their time <unk> to English <unk> whale-ships , and both exact and reliable men .
The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their <unk> is <unk> small ; but so far as it goes , it is of excellent quality , though mostly <unk> to scientific description .
As yet , however , the sperm whale , scientific or <unk> , lives not complete in any <unk> .
Far above all other hunted whales , his is an <unk> life .
Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular <unk> classification , if only an easy outline one for the present , hereafter to be filled in all its <unk> by subsequent laborers .
As no better man advances to take this matter in hand , I <unk> offer my own poor endeavors .
I promise nothing complete ; because any human thing supposed to be complete , must for that very reason infallibly be <unk> .
I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species , or — in this place at least — to much of any description .
My object here is simply to <unk> the draught of a <unk> of cetology .
I am the <unk> , not the <unk> .
But it is a ponderous task ; no ordinary <unk> in the <unk> is equal to it .
To <unk> down into the bottom of the sea after them ; to have one ’ s hands among the unspeakable foundations , ribs , and very <unk> of the world ; this is a fearful thing .
What am I that I should <unk> to hook the nose of this leviathan !
The awful <unk> in Job might well <unk> me .
Will he ( the leviathan ) make a <unk> with thee ?
<unk> the hope of him is vain !
But I have swam through <unk> and sailed through oceans ; I have had to do with whales with these visible hands ; I am in earnest ; and I will try .
There are some <unk> to settle .
First : The uncertain , <unk> condition of this science of Cetology is in the very <unk> <unk> by the fact , that in some quarters it still remains a <unk> point whether a whale be a fish .
In his <unk> of Nature , A.D. <unk> , Linnæus <unk> , “ I hereby separate the whales from the fish . ” But of my own knowledge , I know that down to the year <unk> , sharks and <unk> , <unk> and herring , against Linnæus ’ s express <unk> , were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan .
The grounds upon which Linnæus would fain have <unk> the whales from the waters , he states as follows : “ On account of their warm <unk> heart , their lungs , their <unk> <unk> , their hollow ears , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , ” and finally , “ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . ” I <unk> all this to my friends <unk> Macey and <unk> Coffin , of Nantucket , both <unk> of mine in a certain voyage , and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether <unk> .
<unk> <unk> hinted they were <unk> .
Be it known that , <unk> all argument , I take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish , and call upon holy Jonah to back me .
This <unk> thing settled , the next point is , in what internal respect does the whale <unk> from other fish .
<unk> , Linnæus has given you those items .
But in brief , they are these : lungs and warm blood ; whereas , all other fish are <unk> and cold <unk> .
Next : how shall we <unk> the whale , by his obvious <unk> , so as <unk> to <unk> him for all time to come ?
To be short , then , a whale is _ a spouting fish with a horizontal tail _ .
There you have him .
However contracted , that definition is the result of expanded meditation .
A walrus spouts much like a whale , but the walrus is not a fish , because he is <unk> .
But the last term of the definition is still more cogent , as <unk> with the first .
Almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat , but a vertical , or <unk> tail .
Whereas , among spouting fish the tail , though it may be <unk> <unk> , invariably <unk> a horizontal position .
By the above definition of what a whale is , I do by no means <unk> from the leviathanic <unk> any sea creature hitherto <unk> with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers ; nor , on the other hand , <unk> with it any fish hitherto <unk> regarded as alien .
* Hence , all the smaller , spouting , and horizontal <unk> fish must be included in this <unk> of Cetology .
Now , then , come the grand <unk> of the entire whale host .
* I am aware that down to the present time , the fish <unk> <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> of Nantucket ) are included by many naturalists among the whales .
But as these <unk> are a <unk> , contemptible set , mostly lurking in the mouths of <unk> , and feeding on wet <unk> , and especially as they do not spout , I deny their <unk> as whales ; and have presented them with their <unk> to quit the <unk> of Cetology .
First : According to magnitude I divide the whales into three <unk> <unk> ( <unk> into <unk> ) , and these shall comprehend them all , both small and large .

BOOK I.
( _ Folio _ ) , CHAPTER I.
( _ Sperm Whale _ ) . — This whale , among the English of old vaguely known as the <unk> whale , and the <unk> whale , and the <unk> <unk> whale , is the present <unk> of the French , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the Long <unk> .
He is , without doubt , the largest <unk> of the globe ; the most <unk> of all whales to encounter ; the most majestic in aspect ; and <unk> , by far the most valuable in commerce ; he being the only creature from which that valuable substance , spermaceti , is obtained .
All his peculiarities will , in many other places , be <unk> upon .
It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do .
<unk> considered , it is <unk> .
Some centuries ago , when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper <unk> , and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish ; in those days spermaceti , it would seem , was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale .
It was the idea also , that this same spermaceti was that <unk> humor of the Greenland Whale which the first <unk> of the word literally <unk> .
In those times , also , spermaceti was exceedingly scarce , not being used for light , but only as an <unk> and <unk> .
It was only to be had from the <unk> as you nowadays <unk> an ounce of <unk> .
When , as I <unk> , in the course of time , the true nature of spermaceti became known , its original name was still retained by the <unk> ; no doubt to <unk> its value by a notion so strangely significant of its <unk> .
And so the <unk> must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived .
BOOK I.
( _ Folio _ ) , CHAPTER II .
( _ Right Whale _ ) . — In one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans , being the one first regularly hunted by man .
It <unk> the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen ; and the oil specially known as “ whale oil , ” an inferior article in commerce .
Among the fishermen , he is <unk> designated by all the following <unk> : The Whale ; the Greenland Whale ; the Black Whale ; the Great Whale ; the True Whale ; the Right Whale .
There is a deal of <unk> concerning the identity of the species thus <unk> <unk> .
What then is the whale , which I include in the second species of my <unk> ?
It is the Great <unk> of the English naturalists ; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen ; the <unk> <unk> of the French whalemen ; the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas ; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean , on the <unk> Banks , on the Nor ’ West <unk> , and various other parts of the world , designated by them Right Whale <unk> <unk> .
Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and the right whale of the Americans .
But they precisely agree in all their grand features ; nor has there yet been presented a single <unk> fact upon which to ground a <unk> distinction .
It is by endless <unk> based upon the most <unk> <unk> , that some <unk> of natural history become so <unk> <unk> .
The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length , with reference to <unk> the sperm whale .
BOOK I.
( _ Folio _ ) , CHAPTER III .
( _ Fin-Back _ ) . — <unk> this head I <unk> a monster which , by the various names of Fin-Back , <unk> , and <unk> , has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic , in the New York <unk> .
In the length he <unk> , and in his baleen , the <unk> <unk> the right whale , but is of a less portly girth , and a lighter colour , approaching to <unk> .
His great lips present a <unk> aspect , formed by the <unk> , <unk> folds of large wrinkles .
His grand <unk> feature , the fin , from which he <unk> his name , is often a conspicuous object .
This fin is some three or four feet long , growing <unk> from the <unk> part of the back , of an <unk> shape , and with a very sharp pointed end .
Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible , this isolated fin will , at times , be seen plainly projecting from the surface .
When the sea is <unk> calm , and slightly marked with <unk> <unk> , and this <unk> fin stands up and <unk> shadows upon the wrinkled surface , it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat <unk> a <unk> , with its style and <unk> <unk> <unk> on it .
On that <unk> the shadow often goes back .
The Fin-Back is not <unk> .
He seems a <unk> , as some men are <unk> .
Very <unk> ; always going solitary ; <unk> rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters ; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall <unk> spear upon a <unk> plain ; <unk> with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming , as to <unk> all present pursuit from man ; this leviathan seems the <unk> and unconquerable <unk> of his race , bearing for his mark that style upon his back .
From having the baleen in his mouth , the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale , among a <unk> species denominated _ <unk> whales _ , that is , whales with baleen .
Of these so called <unk> whales , there would seem to be several varieties , most of which , however , are little known .
<unk> whales and <unk> whales ; <unk> whales ; <unk> whales ; <unk> whales and <unk> whales , are the fishermen ’ s names for a few sorts .
In <unk> with this <unk> of “ <unk> whales , ” it is of great importance to mention , that however such a <unk> may be convenient in <unk> allusions to some kind of whales , yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan , founded upon either his baleen , or hump , or fin , or teeth ; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very <unk> seem better adapted to afford the <unk> for a regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily <unk> , which the whale , in his <unk> , presents .
How then ?
The baleen , hump , <unk> , and teeth ; these are things whose peculiarities are <unk> <unk> among all sorts of whales , without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more <unk> particulars .
Thus , the sperm whale and the <unk> whale , each has a hump ; but there the <unk> <unk> .
Then , this same <unk> whale and the Greenland whale , each of these has baleen ; but there again the <unk> <unk> .
And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned .
In various sorts of whales , they form such irregular <unk> ; or , in the case of any one of them detached , such an irregular <unk> ; as utterly to <unk> all general <unk> formed upon such a <unk> .
On this rock every one of the <unk> has split .
But it may possibly be <unk> that , in the internal parts of the whale , in his anatomy — there , at least , we shall be able to hit the right classification .
Nay ; what thing , for example , is there in the Greenland whale ’ s anatomy more striking than his baleen ?
Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to <unk> the Greenland whale .
And if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans , why there you will not find <unk> a <unk> part as available to the <unk> as those external ones already <unk> .
What then remains ?
nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily , in their entire <unk> volume , and boldly sort them that way .
And this is the <unk> system here <unk> ; and it is the only one that can possibly succeed , for it alone is practicable .
To proceed .

( _ <unk> Back _ ) . — This whale is often seen on the northern American coast .
He has been frequently captured there , and towed into harbor .
He has a great pack on him like a <unk> ; or you might call him the <unk> and <unk> whale .
At any rate , the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him , since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one .
His oil is not very valuable .
He has baleen .
He is the most gamesome and <unk> of all the whales , making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them .
BOOK I.
( _ Folio _ ) , CHAPTER V. ( _ <unk> Back _ ) . — Of this whale little is known but his name .
I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn .
Of a <unk> nature , he <unk> both hunters and philosophers .
Though no coward , he has never yet shown any part of him but his back , which rises in a long sharp <unk> .
Let him go .
I know little more of him , nor does anybody else .
BOOK I.
( _ Folio _ ) , CHAPTER <unk> .
( _ <unk> <unk> _ ) . — Another <unk> gentleman , with a <unk> belly , doubtless got by scraping along the <unk> <unk> in some of his <unk> <unk> .
He is seldom seen ; at least I have never seen him except in the <unk> southern seas , and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance .
He is never chased ; he would run away with <unk> of line .
<unk> are told of him .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> !
I can say nothing more that is true of ye , nor can the oldest Nantucketer .
Thus ends BOOK I.
( _ Folio _ ) , and now begins BOOK II .
( _ Octavo _ ) .
<unk> .
* — These <unk> the whales of <unk> magnitude , among which present may be <unk> : — I. , the _ Grampus _ ; II . , the _ Black Fish _ ; III . , the _ Narwhale _ ; IV . , the _ <unk> _ ; V. , the _ Killer _ .
* Why this book of whales is not denominated the <unk> is very plain .
Because , while the whales of this order , though smaller than those of the former order , nevertheless retain a <unk> likeness to them in figure , yet the <unk> ’ s <unk> volume in its <unk> form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume , but the Octavo volume does .
BOOK II .
( _ Octavo _ ) , CHAPTER I.
( _ Grampus _ ) . — Though this fish , whose loud <unk> breathing , or rather blowing , has furnished a proverb to landsmen , is so well known a <unk> of the deep , yet is he not popularly <unk> among whales .
But <unk> all the grand <unk> features of the leviathan , most naturalists have recognised him for one .
He is of <unk> <unk> size , <unk> from fifteen to <unk> feet in length , and of corresponding <unk> round the waist .
He swims in herds ; he is never regularly hunted , though his oil is considerable in quantity , and pretty good for light .
By some fishermen his approach is regarded as <unk> of the advance of the great sperm whale .
BOOK II .
( _ Octavo _ ) , CHAPTER II .
( _ Black Fish _ ) . — I give the popular fishermen ’ s names for all these fish , for generally they are the best .
Where any name happens to be vague or <unk> , I shall say so , and <unk> another .
I do so now , touching the Black Fish , <unk> , because blackness is the rule among almost all whales .
So , call him the Hyena Whale , if you please .
His <unk> is well known , and from the circumstance that the inner <unk> of his lips are curved upwards , he carries an everlasting <unk> grin on his face .
This whale <unk> some sixteen or eighteen feet in length .
He is found in almost all latitudes .
He has a peculiar way of showing his <unk> hooked fin in swimming , which looks something like a Roman nose .
When not more <unk> employed , the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale , to keep up the supply of <unk> oil for domestic <unk> — as some <unk> <unk> , in the absence of company , and quite alone by themselves , burn <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> <unk> .
Though their blubber is very thin , some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil .
BOOK II .
( _ Octavo _ ) , CHAPTER III .
( _ Narwhale _ ) , that is , _ <unk> whale _ . — Another instance of a curiously named whale , so named I suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a <unk> nose .
The creature is some sixteen feet in length , while its horn <unk> five feet , though some exceed ten , and even <unk> to fifteen feet .
<unk> speaking , this horn is but a <unk> <unk> , growing out from the jaw in a line a little <unk> from the horizontal .
But it is only found on the <unk> side , which has an ill effect , giving its owner something <unk> to the aspect of a clumsy <unk> man .
What precise purpose this ivory horn or lance <unk> , it would be hard to say .
It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and <unk> ; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale <unk> it for a <unk> in turning over the bottom of the sea for food .
<unk> Coffin said it was used for an <unk> ; for the Narwhale , rising to the surface of the Polar Sea , and finding it <unk> with ice , <unk> his horn up , and so breaks through .
But you cannot prove either of these <unk> to be correct .
My own opinion is , that however this <unk> horn may really be used by the Narwhale — however that may be — it would certainly be very convenient to him for a <unk> in reading <unk> .
The Narwhale I have heard called the <unk> whale , the <unk> whale , and the <unk> whale .
He is certainly a curious example of the <unk> to be found in almost every <unk> of animated nature .
From certain <unk> old <unk> I have gathered that this same <unk> ’ s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great <unk> against poison , and as such , <unk> of it brought immense <unk> .
It was also <unk> to a <unk> <unk> for <unk> ladies , the same way that the horns of the male <unk> are <unk> into <unk> .
<unk> it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity .
Black <unk> tells me that Sir <unk> <unk> on his return from that voyage , when Queen <unk> did <unk> wave her <unk> hand to him from a window of <unk> <unk> , as his bold ship sailed down the <unk> ; “ when Sir <unk> returned from that voyage , ” saith Black <unk> , “ on <unk> knees he presented to her <unk> a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale , which for a long period after hung in the <unk> at <unk> . ” An <unk> author <unk> that the <unk> of <unk> , on <unk> knees , did likewise present to her <unk> another horn , pertaining to a land beast of the <unk> nature .
The Narwhale has a very <unk> , <unk> look , being of a <unk> ground colour , dotted with round and <unk> <unk> of black .
His oil is very superior , clear and fine ; but there is little of it , and he is seldom hunted .
He is mostly found in the <unk> seas .
BOOK II .
( _ Octavo _ ) , CHAPTER IV .
( _ Killer _ ) . — Of this whale little is precisely known to the Nantucketer , and nothing at all to the <unk> <unk> .
From what I have seen of him at a distance , I should say that he was about the <unk> of a <unk> .
He is very savage — a sort of <unk> fish .
He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip , and hangs there like a <unk> , till the mighty brute is <unk> to death .
The Killer is never hunted .
I never heard what sort of oil he has .
<unk> might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale , on the ground of its <unk> .
For we are all <unk> , on land and on sea ; <unk> and <unk> included .
BOOK II .
( _ Octavo _ ) , CHAPTER V. ( _ <unk> _ ) . — This gentleman is famous for his tail , which he uses for a <unk> in <unk> his foes .
He mounts the Folio whale ’ s back , and as he swims , he works his passage by <unk> him ; as some <unk> get along in the world by a similar process .
Still less is known of the <unk> than of the Killer .
Both are <unk> , even in the <unk> seas .
Thus ends BOOK II .
( _ Octavo _ ) , and begins BOOK III .
( _ Duodecimo _ ) .
<unk> . — These include the smaller whales .
I.
The Huzza Porpoise .
II .
The <unk> Porpoise .
III .
The <unk> Porpoise .
To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject , it may possibly seem strange , that <unk> not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be <unk> among <unk> — a word , which , in the popular sense , always <unk> an idea of <unk> .
But the creatures set down above as <unk> are infallibly whales , by the terms of my definition of what a whale is — _ <unk> _ a spouting fish , with a horizontal tail .
BOOK III .
( _ Duodecimo _ ) , CHAPTER 1 .
( _ Huzza Porpoise _ ) . — This is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe .
The name is of my own <unk> ; for there are more than one sort of porpoises , and something must be done to distinguish them .
I call him thus , because he always swims in <unk> shoals , which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like <unk> in a <unk> crowd .
Their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner .
<unk> of fine spirits , they invariably come from the <unk> billows to windward .
They are the lads that always live before the wind .
They are accounted a lucky omen .
If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these <unk> fish , then heaven help ye ; the spirit of <unk> <unk> is not in ye .
A <unk> , <unk> Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good <unk> of good oil .
But the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable .
It is in request among <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> put it on their <unk> .
Porpoise meat is good eating , you know .
It may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts .
Indeed , his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible .
But the next time you have a chance , watch him ; and you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in <unk> .
BOOK III .
( _ Duodecimo _ ) , CHAPTER II .
( _ <unk> Porpoise _ ) . — A pirate .
Very savage .
He is only found , I think , in the Pacific .
He is somewhat larger than the Huzza Porpoise , but much of the same general make .
<unk> him , and he will <unk> to a shark .
I have lowered for him many times , but never yet saw him captured .
BOOK III .
( _ Duodecimo _ ) , CHAPTER III .
( _ <unk> Porpoise _ ) . — The largest kind of Porpoise ; and only found in the Pacific , so far as it is known .
The only English name , by which he has hitherto been designated , is that of the <unk> — <unk> Porpoise , from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio .
In shape , he <unk> in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise , being of a less <unk> and jolly girth ; indeed , he is of quite a <unk> and <unk> figure .
He has no fins on his back ( most other porpoises have ) , he has a lovely tail , and <unk> Indian eyes of a <unk> hue .
But his <unk> <unk> all .
Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable , yet a <unk> line , distinct as the mark in a ship ’ s hull , called the “ bright waist , ” that line <unk> him from <unk> to stern , with two separate colours , black above and white below .
The white <unk> part of his head , and the whole of his mouth , which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a <unk> visit to a <unk> .
A most mean and <unk> aspect !
His oil is much like that of the common porpoise .
* * * * * * <unk> the <unk> , this system does not proceed , inasmuch as the Porpoise is the smallest of the whales .
<unk> , you have all the Leviathans of note .
But there are a <unk> of uncertain , fugitive , <unk> whales , which , as an American whaleman , I know by reputation , but not personally .
I shall <unk> them by their <unk> <unk> ; for possibly such a list may be valuable to future <unk> , who may complete what I have here but <unk> .
If any of the following whales , shall hereafter be caught and marked , then he can readily be <unk> into this <unk> , according to his Folio , Octavo , or Duodecimo magnitude : — The <unk> Whale ; the <unk> Whale ; the <unk> Whale ; the Cape Whale ; the <unk> Whale ; the <unk> Whale ; the <unk> Whale ; the <unk> Whale ; the <unk> Whale ; the <unk> Whale ; the <unk> Whale ; the <unk> Whale ; <unk> .
From <unk> , Dutch , and old English authorities , there might be <unk> other <unk> of uncertain whales , blessed with all manner of <unk> names .
But I <unk> them as altogether <unk> ; and can hardly help <unk> them for mere sounds , full of <unk> , but <unk> nothing .
<unk> : It was stated at the <unk> , that this system would not be here , and at once , <unk> .
You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my word .
But I now leave my <unk> <unk> standing thus <unk> , even as the great <unk> of <unk> was left , with the <unk> still standing upon the top of the <unk> tower .
For small <unk> may be finished by their first <unk> ; grand ones , true ones , ever leave the <unk> to <unk> .
God keep me from ever <unk> anything .
This whole book is but a draught — nay , but the draught of a draught .
Oh , Time , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> !
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Specksnyder .
<unk> the officers of the <unk> , this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on <unk> , <unk> from the existence of the harpooneer <unk> of officers , a <unk> unknown of course in any other <unk> than the <unk> .
The large importance attached to the harpooneer ’ s vocation is evinced by the fact , that originally in the old Dutch Fishery , two centuries and more ago , the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain , but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksnyder .
<unk> this word means <unk> ; usage , however , in time made it <unk> to Chief <unk> .
In those days , the captain ’ s authority was <unk> to the <unk> and general management of the vessel ; while over the <unk> <unk> and all its <unk> , the Specksnyder or Chief <unk> reigned <unk> .
In the <unk> Greenland Fishery , under the <unk> title of <unk> , this old Dutch official is still retained , but his former dignity is sadly <unk> .
At present he <unk> simply as <unk> <unk> ; and as such , is but one of the captain ’ s more inferior <unk> .
Nevertheless , as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends , and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat , but under certain circumstances ( night watches on a whaling ground ) the command of the ship ’ s deck is also his ; therefore the grand <unk> <unk> of the sea <unk> , that he should <unk> live apart from the men before the mast , and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior ; though always , by them , familiarly regarded as their social equal .
Now , the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea , is this — the first lives aft , the last forward .
Hence , in whale-ships and <unk> alike , the mates have their quarters with the captain ; and so , too , in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship .
That is to say , they take their meals in the captain ’ s cabin , and sleep in a place indirectly <unk> with it .
Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage ( by far the <unk> of all voyages now or ever made by man ) , the peculiar perils of it , and the <unk> of interest <unk> among a company , all of whom , high or low , depend for their profits , not upon fixed <unk> , but upon their common luck , together with their common vigilance , <unk> , and hard work ; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less <unk> <unk> than in <unk> generally ; yet , never mind how much like an old <unk> family these whalemen may , in some <unk> instances , live together ; for all that , the <unk> <unk> , at least , of the quarter-deck are seldom <unk> <unk> , and in no instance done away .
Indeed , many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the <unk> <unk> his quarter-deck with an <unk> grandeur not <unk> in any military navy ; nay , <unk> almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple , and not the <unk> of <unk> .
And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given to that sort of <unk> <unk> ; and though the only homage he ever <unk> , was <unk> , instantaneous obedience ; though he <unk> no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck ; and though there were times when , owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be <unk> , he addressed them in unusual terms , whether of <unk> or _ in <unk> _ , or otherwise ; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means <unk> of the <unk> forms and <unk> of the sea .
Nor , perhaps , will it fail to be eventually perceived , that behind those forms and <unk> , as it were , he sometimes <unk> himself ; incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were <unk> intended to <unk> .
That certain <unk> of his brain , which had otherwise in a good degree remained <unk> ; through those forms that same <unk> became <unk> in an irresistible <unk> .
For be a man ’ s intellectual superiority what it will , it can never <unk> the practical , available <unk> over other men , without the <unk> of some sort of external <unk> and <unk> , always , in themselves , more or less <unk> and base .
This it is , that for ever keeps God ’ s true <unk> of the <unk> from the world ’ s <unk> ; and leaves the highest <unk> that this air can give , to those men who become famous more through their infinite <unk> to the choice hidden handful of the <unk> <unk> , than through their <unk> superiority over the dead level of the mass .
Such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme <unk> superstitions invest them , that in some royal instances even to <unk> <unk> they have <unk> potency .
But when , as in the case of <unk> the Czar , the <unk> crown of <unk> <unk> <unk> an imperial brain ; then , the <unk> herds <unk> <unk> before the tremendous <unk> .
Nor , will the tragic <unk> who would <unk> mortal <unk> in its fullest sweep and direct swing , ever forget a hint , incidentally so important in his art , as the one now alluded to .
But Ahab , my Captain , still <unk> before me in all his Nantucket <unk> and <unk> ; and in this <unk> touching Emperors and Kings , I must not <unk> that I have only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like him ; and , therefore , all outward <unk> <unk> and <unk> are <unk> me .
Oh , Ahab !
what shall be grand in thee , it must needs be <unk> at from the skies , and dived for in the deep , and <unk> in the <unk> air !
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
It is noon ; and Dough-Boy , the steward , thrusting his pale <unk> face from the cabin-scuttle , <unk> dinner to his lord and master ; who , sitting in the lee <unk> , has just been taking an observation of the sun ; and is now <unk> <unk> the latitude on the smooth , <unk> <unk> , reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg .
From his complete <unk> to the <unk> , you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his <unk> .
But presently , catching hold of the <unk> shrouds , he swings himself to the deck , and in an even , <unk> voice , saying , “ <unk> , Mr. Starbuck , ” <unk> into the cabin .
When the last <unk> of his <unk> ’ s step has died away , and Starbuck , the first <unk> , has every reason to suppose that he is seated , then Starbuck <unk> from his quietude , takes a few turns along the planks , and , after a grave peep into the binnacle , says , with some touch of <unk> , “ <unk> , Mr. Stubb , ” and <unk> the scuttle .
The second <unk> <unk> about the rigging awhile , and then slightly shaking the main brace , to see whether it will be all right with that important rope , he likewise takes up the old burden , and with a rapid “ <unk> , Mr. Flask , ” follows after his <unk> .
But the third <unk> , now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck , seems to feel relieved from some curious <unk> ; for , <unk> all sorts of knowing <unk> in all sorts of directions , and kicking off his shoes , he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a <unk> right over the Grand Turk ’ s head ; and then , by a dexterous <unk> , pitching his cap up into the <unk> for a shelf , he goes down <unk> so far at least as he remains visible from the deck , <unk> all other <unk> , by bringing up the rear with <unk> .
But ere stepping into the cabin <unk> below , he <unk> , ships a new face altogether , and , then , independent , <unk> little Flask enters King Ahab ’ s presence , in the character of <unk> , or the <unk> .
It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense <unk> of <unk> , that while in the open air of the deck some officers will , upon <unk> , bear themselves boldly and <unk> enough towards their commander ; yet , ten to one , let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander ’ s cabin , and straightway their <unk> , not to say <unk> and <unk> air towards him , as he sits at the head of the table ; this is marvellous , sometimes most comical .
Wherefore this difference ?
A problem ?
Perhaps not .
To have been Belshazzar , King of <unk> ; and to have been Belshazzar , not <unk> but <unk> , therein certainly must have been some touch of <unk> grandeur .
But he who in the <unk> regal and intelligent spirit <unk> over his own private <unk> of invited guests , that man ’ s <unk> power and <unk> of individual influence for the time ; that man ’ s royalty of state <unk> Belshazzar ’ s , for Belshazzar was not the greatest .
Who has but once <unk> his friends , has <unk> what it is to be <unk> .
It is a <unk> of social <unk> which there is no <unk> .
Now , if to this consideration you <unk> the official <unk> of a <unk> , then , by inference , you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of <unk> just mentioned .
<unk> his <unk> table , Ahab <unk> like a <unk> , <unk> <unk> on the white coral beach , surrounded by his <unk> but still <unk> <unk> .
In his own proper turn , each officer <unk> to be served .
They were as little children before Ahab ; and yet , in Ahab , there seemed not to lurk the smallest social <unk> .
With one mind , their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man ’ s knife , as he carved the chief dish before him .
I do not suppose that for the world they would have <unk> that moment with the slightest observation , even upon so <unk> a <unk> as the weather .
No !
And when reaching out his knife and <unk> , between which the <unk> of beef was locked , Ahab thereby <unk> Starbuck ’ s plate towards him , the mate received his meat as though receiving <unk> ; and cut it <unk> ; and a little started if , <unk> , the knife <unk> against the plate ; and chewed it <unk> ; and swallowed it , not without <unk> .
For , like the <unk> banquet at <unk> , where the German <unk> <unk> <unk> with the seven <unk> <unk> , so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals , <unk> in awful silence ; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not <unk> ; only he himself was dumb .
What a relief it was to <unk> Stubb , when a <unk> made a sudden <unk> in the hold below .
And poor little Flask , he was the <unk> son , and little boy of this weary family party .
His were the <unk> of the <unk> beef ; his would have been the <unk> .
For Flask to have presumed to help himself , this must have seemed to him <unk> to <unk> in the first degree .
Had he helped himself at that table , doubtless , never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world ; nevertheless , strange to say , Ahab never forbade him .
And had Flask helped himself , the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it .
<unk> of all , did Flask presume to help himself to butter .
Whether he thought the owners of the ship <unk> it to him , on account of its <unk> his clear , sunny complexion ; or whether he deemed that , on so long a voyage in such <unk> waters , butter was at a <unk> , and therefore was not for him , a <unk> ; however it was , Flask , alas !
was a <unk> man !
Another thing .
Flask was the last person down at the dinner , and Flask is the first man up .
Consider !
For hereby Flask ’ s dinner was badly <unk> in point of time .
Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him ; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear .
If Stubb even , who is but a <unk> higher than Flask , happens to have but a small <unk> , and soon shows symptoms of concluding his <unk> , then Flask must <unk> himself , he will not get more than three <unk> that day ; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to <unk> Flask to the deck .
Therefore it was that Flask once <unk> in private , that ever since he had <unk> to the dignity of an officer , from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than <unk> , more or less .
For what he <unk> did not so much <unk> his <unk> , as keep it immortal in him .
<unk> and satisfaction , thought Flask , have for ever departed from my stomach .
I am an officer ; but , how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned beef in the forecastle , as I used to when I was before the mast .
There ’ s the <unk> of <unk> now ; there ’ s the <unk> of glory : there ’ s the insanity of life !
Besides , if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a <unk> against Flask in Flask ’ s official <unk> , all that sailor had to do , in order to obtain <unk> vengeance , was to go aft at <unk> , and get a peep at Flask through the cabin <unk> , sitting silly and <unk> before awful Ahab .
Now , Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the Pequod ’ s cabin .
After their <unk> , taking place in inverted order to their arrival , the canvas <unk> was cleared , or rather was <unk> to some hurried order by the <unk> steward .
And then the three harpooneers were <unk> to the feast , they being its <unk> <unk> .
They made a sort of temporary <unk> ’ <unk> of the high and mighty cabin .
In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable <unk> and nameless invisible <unk> of the captain ’ s table , was the entire <unk> license and ease , the almost frantic <unk> of those inferior fellows the harpooneers .
While their <unk> , the mates , seemed afraid of the sound of the <unk> of their own jaws , the harpooneers chewed their food with such a <unk> that there was a report to it .
They <unk> like <unk> ; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day <unk> with <unk> .
Such portentous <unk> had Queequeg and Tashtego , that to fill out the <unk> made by the previous <unk> , often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great <unk> of <unk> , seemingly <unk> out of the solid ox .
And if he were not lively about it , if he did not go with a <unk> <unk> , then Tashtego had an <unk> way of <unk> him by darting a <unk> at his back , <unk> .
And once Daggoo , seized with a sudden humor , <unk> Dough-Boy ’ s memory by snatching him up bodily , and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden <unk> , while Tashtego , knife in hand , began laying out the circle preliminary to <unk> him .
He was naturally a very nervous , shuddering sort of little fellow , this <unk> steward ; the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> .
And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab , and the <unk> tumultuous <unk> of these three savages , Dough-Boy ’ s whole life was one continual <unk> .
<unk> , after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded , he would escape from their <unk> into his little <unk> <unk> , and <unk> peep out at them through the blinds of its door , till all was over .
It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego , opposing his <unk> teeth to the Indian ’ s : <unk> to them , Daggoo seated on the floor , for a bench would have brought his <unk> head to the low <unk> ; at every motion of his colossal limbs , making the low cabin <unk> to shake , as when an <unk> elephant goes passenger in a ship .
But for all this , the great negro was <unk> <unk> , not to say <unk> .
It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small <unk> he could keep up the vitality <unk> through so broad , <unk> , and <unk> a person .
But , doubtless , this noble savage <unk> strong and <unk> deep of the abounding element of air ; and through his <unk> nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds .
Not by beef or by bread , are <unk> made or <unk> .
But Queequeg , he had a mortal , barbaric <unk> of the lip in eating — an <unk> sound enough — so much so , that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms .
And when he would hear Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself , that his bones might be picked , the <unk> steward all but shattered the <unk> hanging round him in the <unk> , by his sudden fits of the <unk> .
Nor did the <unk> which the harpooneers carried in their pockets , for their lances and other weapons ; and with which <unk> , at dinner , they would <unk> <unk> their knives ; that <unk> sound did not at all tend to <unk> poor Dough-Boy .
How could he forget that in his Island days , Queequeg , for one , must certainly have been guilty of some murderous , convivial <unk> .
<unk> !
Dough-Boy !
hard <unk> the white <unk> who <unk> upon cannibals .
Not a <unk> should he carry on his arm , but a <unk> .
In good time , though , to his great delight , the three <unk> <unk> would rise and depart ; to his credulous , <unk> ears , all their <unk> bones <unk> in them at every step , like <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
But , though these <unk> <unk> in the cabin , and <unk> lived there ; still , being anything but <unk> in their habits , they were scarcely ever in it except at <unk> , and just before <unk> , when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters .
In this one matter , Ahab seemed no <unk> to most American whale captains , who , as a set , rather <unk> to the opinion that by rights the ship ’ s cabin belongs to them ; and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is , at any time , permitted there .
So that , in real truth , the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it .
For when they did enter it , it was something as a <unk> enters a house ; turning <unk> for a moment , only to be turned out the next ; and , as a permanent thing , <unk> in the open air .
Nor did they lose much hereby ; in the cabin was no <unk> ; <unk> , Ahab was <unk> .
Though <unk> included in the census of Christendom , he was still an alien to it .
He lived in the world , as the last of the <unk> <unk> lived in settled <unk> .
And as when Spring and <unk> had departed , that wild <unk> of the woods , <unk> himself in the hollow of a tree , lived out the winter there , sucking his own <unk> ; so , in his <unk> , howling old age , Ahab ’ s soul , shut up in the <unk> trunk of his body , there <unk> upon the sullen <unk> of its gloom !
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
It was during the more pleasant weather , that in due <unk> with the other seamen my first mast-head came round .
In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessel ’ s leaving her port ; even though she may have fifteen thousand miles , and more , to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground .
And if , after a three , four , or five years ’ voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her — say , an empty vial even — then , her mast-heads are kept manned to the last ; and not till her <unk> sail in among the spires of the port , does she altogether <unk> the hope of <unk> one whale more .
Now , as the business of standing mast-heads , ashore or afloat , is a very ancient and interesting one , let us in some measure <unk> here .
I take it , that the <unk> <unk> of mast-heads were the old Egyptians ; because , in all my <unk> , I find none prior to them .
For though their <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , must doubtless , by their tower , have intended to rear the <unk> mast-head in all Asia , or Africa either ; yet ( ere the final <unk> was put to it ) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board , in the dread gale of God ’ s wrath ; therefore , we cannot give these <unk> <unk> <unk> over the Egyptians .
And that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head <unk> , is an <unk> based upon the general belief among <unk> , that the first <unk> were founded for <unk> <unk> : a theory singularly <unk> by the peculiar <unk> <unk> of all four sides of those <unk> ; whereby , with prodigious long <unk> of their legs , those old <unk> were wont to mount to the <unk> , and sing out for new stars ; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail , or a whale just bearing in sight .
In <unk> <unk> , the famous Christian <unk> of old times , who built him a lofty stone <unk> in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit , hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle ; in him we have a remarkable instance of a <unk> <unk> ; who was not to be driven from his place by <unk> or <unk> , rain , hail , or sleet ; but <unk> facing everything out to the last , literally died at his post .
Of modern <unk> we have but a lifeless set ; mere stone , iron , and <unk> men ; who , though well capable of facing out a stiff gale , are still entirely <unk> to the business of singing out upon <unk> any strange sight .
There is <unk> ; who , upon the top of the <unk> of <unk> , stands with arms folded , some one hundred and fifty feet in the air ; careless , now , who rules the decks below ; whether Louis <unk> , Louis <unk> , or Louis the <unk> .
Great Washington , too , stands high aloft on his <unk> main-mast in <unk> , and like one of Hercules ’ <unk> , his <unk> marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go .
<unk> <unk> , also , on a capstan of <unk> , stands his mast-head in <unk> <unk> ; and ever when most <unk> by that London smoke , token is yet given that a hidden <unk> is there ; for where there is smoke , must be fire .
But neither great Washington , nor <unk> , nor <unk> , will answer a single hail from below , however <unk> <unk> to <unk> by their <unk> the distracted decks upon which they gaze ; however it may be <unk> , that their spirits <unk> through the thick <unk> of the future , and <unk> what shoals and what rocks must be <unk> .
It may seem <unk> to couple in any respect the mast-head <unk> of the land with those of the sea ; but that in truth it is not so , is plainly evinced by an <unk> for which <unk> <unk> , the sole <unk> of Nantucket , stands <unk> .
The worthy <unk> tells us , that in the early times of the whale fishery , ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game , the people of that island erected lofty spars along the <unk> , to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed <unk> , something as fowls go <unk> in a <unk> .
A few years ago this same plan was <unk> by the <unk> whalemen of New Zealand , who , upon <unk> the game , gave notice to the <unk> boats nigh the beach .
But this custom has now become <unk> ; turn we then to the one proper mast-head , that of a whale-ship at sea .
The three mast-heads are kept manned from <unk> to <unk> ; the seamen taking their regular turns ( as at the helm ) , and <unk> each other every two hours .
In the serene weather of the <unk> it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head ; nay , to a dreamy <unk> man it is <unk> .
There you stand , a hundred feet above the silent decks , striding along the deep , as if the masts were gigantic <unk> , while beneath you and between your legs , as it were , swim the <unk> monsters of the sea , even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous <unk> at old <unk> .
There you stand , lost in the infinite series of the sea , with nothing <unk> but the waves .
The <unk> ship <unk> rolls ; the <unk> <unk> winds blow ; everything <unk> you into <unk> .
For the most part , in this tropic whaling life , a sublime <unk> invests you ; you hear no news ; read no <unk> ; <unk> with <unk> accounts of <unk> never <unk> you into unnecessary <unk> ; you hear of no domestic <unk> ; <unk> <unk> ; fall of <unk> ; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner — for all your meals for three years and more are snugly <unk> in casks , and your bill of fare is <unk> .
In one of those southern <unk> , on a long three or four years ’ voyage , as often happens , the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-head would amount to several entire months .
And it is much to be <unk> that the place to which you <unk> so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life , should be so sadly <unk> of anything approaching to a cosy <unk> , or adapted to <unk> a comfortable <unk> of feeling , such as <unk> to a bed , a hammock , a hearse , a <unk> box , a pulpit , a <unk> , or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily <unk> themselves .
Your most usual point of perch is the head of the t ’ <unk> , where you stand upon two thin parallel <unk> ( almost peculiar to whalemen ) called the t ’ gallant cross-trees .
Here , tossed about by the sea , the <unk> feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull ’ s horns .
To be sure , in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you , in the shape of a <unk> ; but properly speaking the <unk> <unk> is no more of a house than the <unk> body ; for as the soul is <unk> inside of its <unk> <unk> , and cannot freely move about in it , nor even move out of it , without running great risk of <unk> ( like an ignorant <unk> crossing the snowy <unk> in winter ) ; so a <unk> is not so much of a house as it is a mere <unk> , or additional skin <unk> you .
You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body , and no more can you make a convenient <unk> of your <unk> .
<unk> all this , it is much to be <unk> that the mast-heads of a southern whale ship are <unk> with those <unk> little <unk> or <unk> , called _ crow ’ <unk> _ , in which the look-outs of a Greenland whaler are protected from the <unk> weather of the frozen seas .
In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet , entitled “ A Voyage among the <unk> , in quest of the Greenland Whale , and incidentally for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of Old Greenland ; ” in this admirable volume , all <unk> of mast-heads are furnished with a <unk> <unk> account of the then recently <unk> _ crow ’ s-nest _ of the <unk> , which was the name of Captain Sleet ’ s good craft .
He called it the _ Sleet ’ s crow ’ s-nest _ , in honor of himself ; he being the original <unk> and <unk> , and free from all ridiculous false delicacy , and holding that if we call our own children after our own names ( we fathers being the original <unk> and <unk> ) , so likewise should we <unk> after ourselves any other <unk> we may beget .
In shape , the Sleet ’ s crow ’ s-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe ; it is open above , however , where it is furnished with a <unk> <unk> to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale .
Being fixed on the summit of the mast , you <unk> into it through a little <unk> in the bottom .
On the after side , or side next the stern of the ship , is a comfortable seat , with a locker <unk> for <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
In front is a leather rack , in which to keep your speaking trumpet , pipe , <unk> , and other <unk> <unk> .
When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this crow ’ s-nest of his , he tells us that he always had a <unk> with him ( also fixed in the rack ) , together with a powder <unk> and shot , for the purpose of <unk> off the <unk> <unk> , or <unk> sea <unk> <unk> those waters ; for you cannot <unk> shoot at them from the deck owing to the <unk> of the water , but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing .
Now , it was plainly a <unk> of love for Captain Sleet to <unk> , as he does , all the little <unk> <unk> of his crow ’ s-nest ; but though he so <unk> upon many of these , and though he <unk> us to a very scientific account of his <unk> in this crow ’ s-nest , with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of <unk> the <unk> <unk> from what is called the “ <unk> <unk> ” of all binnacle <unk> ; an <unk> <unk> to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship ’ s planks , and in the <unk> ’ s case , perhaps , to there having been so many <unk> <unk> among her crew ; I say , that though the Captain is very <unk> and scientific here , yet , for all his learned “ binnacle <unk> , ” “ <unk> compass <unk> , ” and “ <unk> <unk> , ” he knows very well , Captain Sleet , that he was not so much <unk> in those profound magnetic <unk> , as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little <unk> , so <unk> <unk> in on one side of his crow ’ s nest , within easy reach of his hand .
Though , upon the whole , I greatly <unk> and even love the brave , the honest , and learned Captain ; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly <unk> that <unk> , seeing what a faithful friend and <unk> it must have been , while with <unk> fingers and hooded head he was studying the <unk> aloft there in that bird ’ s nest within three or four <unk> of the pole .
But if we Southern <unk> are not so snugly <unk> aloft as Captain Sleet and his <unk> were ; yet that <unk> is greatly <unk> by the widely contrasting serenity of those <unk> seas in which we South <unk> mostly float .
For one , I used to <unk> up the rigging very <unk> , resting in the top to have a chat with Queequeg , or any one else off duty whom I might find there ; then ascending a little way further , and throwing a <unk> leg over the <unk> yard , take a preliminary view of the watery <unk> , and so at last mount to my ultimate <unk> .
Let me make a clean breast of it here , and <unk> admit that I kept but sorry guard .
With the problem of the universe revolving in me , how could I — being left completely to myself at such a <unk> <unk> — how could I but lightly hold my <unk> to observe all whale-ships ’ standing orders , “ <unk> your weather eye open , and sing out every time . ” And let me in this place <unk> <unk> you , ye <unk> of Nantucket !
Beware of <unk> in your <unk> <unk> any lad with lean brow and hollow eye ; given to <unk> <unk> ; and who <unk> to ship with the <unk> instead of <unk> in his head .
Beware of such an one , I say ; your whales must be seen before they can be killed ; and this <unk> young <unk> will tow you ten wakes round the world , and never make you one <unk> of sperm the <unk> .
Nor are these <unk> at all <unk> .
For nowadays , the <unk> <unk> an <unk> for many romantic , melancholy , and absent-minded young men , <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of earth , and seeking <unk> in tar and blubber .
<unk> <unk> not <unk> <unk> himself upon the mast-head of some <unk> <unk> whale-ship , and in moody phrase <unk> : — “ <unk> on , thou deep and dark blue ocean , roll !
<unk> thousand <unk> sweep over thee in vain . ” Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young philosophers to task , <unk> them with not feeling sufficient “ interest ” in the voyage ; <unk> that they are so hopelessly lost to all honorable <unk> , as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise .
But all in vain ; those young <unk> have a notion that their vision is <unk> ; they are <unk> ; what use , then , to strain the <unk> <unk> ?
They have left their <unk> at home .
“ Why , thou monkey , ” said a harpooneer to one of these lads , “ we ’ ve been cruising now hard upon three years , and thou hast not raised a whale yet .
Whales are scarce as <unk> ’ s teeth whenever thou art up here . ” Perhaps they were ; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon ; but <unk> into such an <unk> <unk> of vacant , unconscious <unk> is this absent-minded youth by the blending <unk> of waves with thoughts , that at last he <unk> his identity ; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep , blue , bottomless soul , <unk> mankind and nature ; and every strange , <unk> , gliding , beautiful thing that <unk> him ; every <unk> , uprising fin of some <unk> form , seems to him the <unk> of those <unk> thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it .
In this enchanted mood , thy spirit <unk> away to whence it came ; becomes <unk> through time and space ; like <unk> ’ s <unk> <unk> ashes , forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over .
There is no life in thee , now , except that rocking life <unk> by a gently rolling ship ; by her , <unk> from the sea ; by the sea , from the inscrutable tides of God .
But while this sleep , this dream is on ye , move your foot or hand an inch ; <unk> your hold at all ; and your identity comes back in horror .
<unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk> .
And perhaps , at <unk> , in the <unk> weather , with one <unk> <unk> you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea , no more to rise for ever .
<unk> it well , ye <unk> !
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
( _ <unk> Ahab : Then , all . _ ) It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe , that one morning shortly after breakfast , Ahab , as was his wont , ascended the <unk> to the deck .
There most <unk> usually walk at that hour , as country gentlemen , after the same <unk> , take a few turns in the garden .
Soon his steady , ivory <unk> was heard , as to and fro he paced his old <unk> , upon planks so familiar to his <unk> , that they were all over dented , like <unk> <unk> , with the peculiar mark of his walk .
Did you <unk> gaze , too , upon that ribbed and dented brow ; there also , you would see still stranger <unk> — the <unk> of his one <unk> , <unk> thought .
But on the occasion in question , those dents looked deeper , even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark .
And , so full of his thought was Ahab , that at every <unk> turn that he made , now at the main-mast and now at the binnacle , you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned , and pace in him as he paced ; so completely <unk> him , indeed , that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement .
“ D ’ ye mark him , Flask ? ” whispered Stubb ; “ the <unk> that ’ s in him <unk> the <unk> .
’ <unk> soon be out . ” The hours wore on ; — Ahab now shut up within his cabin ; anon , pacing the deck , with the same intense <unk> of purpose in his aspect .
It drew near the close of day .
Suddenly he came to a <unk> by the bulwarks , and <unk> his bone leg into the <unk> there , and with one hand grasping a shroud , he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft .
“ Sir ! ” said the mate , astonished at an order seldom or never given on <unk> except in some extraordinary case .
“ <unk> everybody aft , ” repeated Ahab .
“ <unk> , there !
come down ! ” When the entire ship ’ s company were <unk> , and with curious and not wholly <unk> faces , were eyeing him , for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up , Ahab , after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks , and then darting his eyes among the crew , started from his <unk> ; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck .
With bent head and <unk> hat he continued to pace , <unk> of the wondering <unk> among the men ; till Stubb <unk> whispered to Flask , that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of <unk> a <unk> feat .
But this did not last long .
<unk> pausing , he cried : — “ What do ye do when ye see a whale , men ? ” “ Sing out for him ! ” was the <unk> <unk> from a score of <unk> voices .
“ Good ! ” cried Ahab , with a wild <unk> in his tones ; observing the hearty <unk> into which his <unk> question had so <unk> thrown them .
“ And what do ye next , men ? ” “ Lower away , and after him ! ” “ And what <unk> is it ye pull to , men ? ” “ A dead whale or a stove boat ! ” More and more strangely and fiercely glad and <unk> , grew the countenance of the old man at every <unk> ; while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other , as if <unk> how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly <unk> questions .
But , they were all eagerness again , as Ahab , now <unk> in his pivot-hole , with one hand reaching high up a shroud , and <unk> , almost <unk> grasping it , addressed them thus : — “ All ye <unk> have before now heard me give orders about a white whale .
Look ye !
d ’ ye see this Spanish ounce of gold ? ” — holding up a broad bright coin to the sun — “ it is a sixteen <unk> piece , men .
D ’ ye see it ?
Mr. Starbuck , hand me yon top-maul . ” While the mate was getting the hammer , Ahab , without speaking , was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the <unk> of his jacket , as if to <unk> its <unk> , and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself , producing a sound so strangely muffled and <unk> that it seemed the mechanical humming of the <unk> of his vitality in him .
<unk> the top-maul from Starbuck , he advanced towards the main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand , <unk> the gold with the other , and with a high raised voice <unk> : “ <unk> of ye raises me a <unk> whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw ; <unk> of ye raises me that <unk> whale , with three <unk> <unk> in his starboard <unk> — look ye , <unk> of ye raises me that same white whale , he shall have this gold ounce , my boys ! ” “ Huzza !
<unk> ! ” cried the seamen , as with swinging <unk> they hailed the act of <unk> the gold to the mast .
“ It ’ s a white whale , I say , ” resumed Ahab , as he threw down the <unk> : “ a white whale .
<unk> your eyes for him , men ; look sharp for white water ; if ye see but a bubble , sing out . ” All this while Tashtego , Daggoo , and Queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest , and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific <unk> .
“ Captain Ahab , ” said Tashtego , “ that white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick . ” “ Moby Dick ? ” shouted Ahab .
“ Do ye know the white whale then , Tash ? ” “ Does he <unk> a little curious , sir , before he goes down ? ” said the <unk> deliberately .
“ And has he a curious spout , too , ” said Daggoo , “ very <unk> , even for a <unk> , and mighty quick , Captain Ahab ? ” “ And he have one , two , three — oh !
good many iron in him hide , too , Captain , ” cried Queequeg <unk> , “ all <unk> <unk> , like him — him — ” <unk> hard for a word , and <unk> his hand round and round as though <unk> a <unk> — “ like him — him — ” “ <unk> ! ” cried Ahab , “ aye , Queequeg , the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him ; aye , Daggoo , his spout is a big one , like a whole shock of <unk> , and white as a pile of our Nantucket <unk> after the great <unk> <unk> ; aye , Tashtego , and he <unk> like a split <unk> in a squall .
Death and devils !
men , it is Moby Dick ye have seen — Moby Dick — Moby Dick ! ” “ Captain Ahab , ” said Starbuck , who , with Stubb and Flask , had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise , but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder .
“ Captain Ahab , I have heard of Moby Dick — but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg ? ” “ Who told thee that ? ” cried Ahab ; then pausing , “ Aye , Starbuck ; aye , my <unk> all round ; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me ; Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now .
Aye , aye , ” he shouted with a terrific , loud , animal <unk> , like that of a <unk> <unk> ; “ Aye , aye !
it was that accursed white whale that <unk> me ; made a poor <unk> <unk> of me for ever and a day ! ” Then tossing both arms , with measureless <unk> he shouted out : “ Aye , aye !
and I ’ ll chase him round Good Hope , and round the Horn , and round the <unk> <unk> , and round <unk> ’ s flames before I give him up .
And this is what ye have shipped for , men !
to chase that white whale on both sides of land , and over all sides of earth , till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out .
What say ye , men , will ye splice hands on it , now ?
I think ye do look brave . ” “ Aye , aye ! ” shouted the harpooneers and seamen , running closer to the excited old man : “ A sharp eye for the white whale ; a sharp lance for Moby Dick ! ” “ God bless ye , ” he seemed to half <unk> and half <unk> .
“ God bless ye , men .
<unk> !
go draw the great measure of <unk> .
But what ’ s this long face about , Mr. Starbuck ; wilt thou not chase the white whale ?
art not game for Moby Dick ? ” “ I am game for his crooked jaw , and for the jaws of Death too , Captain Ahab , if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow ; but I came here to hunt whales , not my commander ’ s vengeance .
How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou <unk> it , Captain Ahab ?
it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket <unk> . ” “ Nantucket <unk> !
<unk> !
But come closer , Starbuck ; thou <unk> a little lower layer .
If money ’ s to be the <unk> , man , and the <unk> have <unk> their great <unk> the globe , by <unk> it with <unk> , one to every three parts of an inch ; then , let me tell thee , that my vengeance will fetch a great <unk> _ here ! _ ” “ He <unk> his chest , ” whispered Stubb , “ what ’ s that for ?
<unk> it rings most vast , but hollow . ” “ <unk> on a dumb brute ! ” cried Starbuck , “ that simply smote thee from <unk> instinct !
<unk> !
To be enraged with a dumb thing , Captain Ahab , seems <unk> . ” “ Hark ye yet again — the little lower layer .
All visible objects , man , are but as <unk> <unk> .
But in each event — in the living act , the <unk> deed — there , some unknown but still <unk> thing <unk> forth the <unk> of its features from behind the <unk> <unk> .
If man will strike , strike through the <unk> !
How can the <unk> reach outside except by thrusting through the wall ?
To me , the white whale is that wall , <unk> near to me .
Sometimes I think there ’ s naught beyond .
But ’ tis enough .
He <unk> me ; he heaps me ; I see in him <unk> strength , with an inscrutable malice <unk> it .
That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate ; and be the white whale agent , or be the white whale principal , I will <unk> that hate upon him .
Talk not to me of <unk> , man ; I ’ d strike the sun if it <unk> me .
For could the sun do that , then could I do the other ; since there is ever a sort of fair play <unk> , <unk> <unk> over all <unk> .
But not my master , man , is even that fair play .
Who ’ s over me ?
Truth hath no <unk> .
Take off thine eye !
more intolerable than fiends ’ <unk> is a <unk> <unk> !
So , so ; thou <unk> and <unk> ; my heat has melted thee to <unk> .
But look ye , Starbuck , what is said in heat , that thing <unk> itself .
There are men from whom warm words are small <unk> .
I meant not to <unk> thee .
Let it go .
Look !
see yonder Turkish cheeks of <unk> <unk> — living , breathing pictures painted by the sun .
The Pagan <unk> — the <unk> and <unk> things , that live ; and seek , and give no reasons for the <unk> life they feel !
The crew , man , the crew !
Are they not one and all with Ahab , in this matter of the whale ?
See Stubb !
he <unk> !
See yonder <unk> !
he <unk> to think of it .
Stand up amid the general <unk> , thy one <unk> <unk> cannot , Starbuck !
And what is it ?
<unk> it .
’ Tis but to help strike a fin ; no wondrous feat for Starbuck .
What is it more ?
From this one poor hunt , then , the best lance out of all Nantucket , <unk> he will not hang back , when every <unk> has <unk> a <unk> ?
Ah !
<unk> seize thee ; I see !
the billow <unk> thee !
<unk> , but speak ! — Aye , aye !
thy silence , then , _ that _ voices thee .
( _ <unk> _ ) Something shot from my <unk> nostrils , he has <unk> it in his lungs .
Starbuck now is mine ; cannot <unk> me now , without <unk> . ” “ God keep me ! — keep us all ! ” murmured Starbuck , lowly .
But in his joy at the enchanted , <unk> <unk> of the mate , Ahab did not hear his <unk> <unk> ; nor yet the low laugh from the hold ; nor yet the <unk> <unk> of the winds in the <unk> ; nor yet the hollow <unk> of the sails against the masts , as for a moment their hearts sank in .
For again Starbuck ’ s <unk> eyes lighted up with the <unk> of life ; the subterranean laugh died away ; the winds blew on ; the sails filled out ; the ship heaved and rolled as before .
Ah , ye <unk> and <unk> !
why stay ye not when ye come ?
But rather are ye <unk> than <unk> , ye shadows !
Yet not so much <unk> from without , as <unk> of the <unk> things within .
For with little external to <unk> us , the innermost <unk> in our being , these still drive us on .
“ The measure !
the measure ! ” cried Ahab .
<unk> the <unk> pewter , and turning to the harpooneers , he ordered them to produce their weapons .
Then ranging them before him near the capstan , with their harpoons in their hands , while his three mates stood at his side with their lances , and the rest of the ship ’ s company formed a circle round the <unk> ; he stood for an instant <unk> eyeing every man of his crew .
But those wild eyes met his , as the <unk> eyes of the prairie <unk> meet the eye of their leader , ere he <unk> on at their head in the <unk> of the <unk> ; but , alas !
only to fall into the hidden <unk> of the Indian .
“ <unk> and pass ! ” he cried , <unk> the heavy <unk> <unk> to the nearest seaman .
“ The crew alone now drink .
Round with it , round !
<unk> <unk> — long <unk> , men ; ’ tis hot as <unk> ’ s <unk> .
So , so ; it goes round <unk> .
It <unk> in ye ; <unk> out at the <unk> eye .
Well done ; almost <unk> .
That way it went , this way it comes .
Hand it me — here ’ s a hollow !
Men , ye seem the years ; so <unk> life is <unk> and gone .
<unk> , <unk> !
“ <unk> now , my <unk> .
I have <unk> ye all round this capstan ; and ye mates , flank me with your lances ; and ye harpooneers , stand there with your irons ; and ye , stout mariners , ring me in , that I may in some sort <unk> a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me .
O men , you will yet see that — Ha !
boy , come back ?
bad <unk> come not sooner .
Hand it me .
Why , now , this pewter had run <unk> again , <unk> ’ t not thou St. <unk> ’ <unk> — away , thou <unk> !
“ <unk> , ye mates !
<unk> your lances full before me .
Well done !
Let me touch the axis . ” So saying , with extended arm , he grasped the three level , <unk> lances at their crossed centre ; while so doing , suddenly and <unk> <unk> them ; meanwhile , glancing intently from Starbuck to Stubb ; from Stubb to Flask .
It seemed as though , by some nameless , interior volition , he would fain have <unk> into them the same fiery emotion <unk> within the <unk> <unk> of his own magnetic life .
The three mates <unk> before his strong , <unk> , and mystic aspect .
Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him ; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright .
“ In vain ! ” cried Ahab ; “ but , <unk> , ’ tis well .
For did ye three but once take the <unk> shock , then mine own <unk> thing , _ that _ had perhaps <unk> from out me .
<unk> , too , it would have dropped ye dead .
<unk> ye need it not .
Down lances !
And now , ye mates , I do <unk> ye three <unk> to my three pagan <unk> there — yon three most honorable gentlemen and <unk> , my valiant harpooneers .
<unk> the task ?
What , when the great <unk> <unk> the feet of <unk> , using his <unk> for <unk> ?
Oh , my sweet <unk> !
your own <unk> , _ that _ shall bend ye to it .
I do not order ye ; ye will it .
<unk> your <unk> and draw the poles , ye harpooneers ! ” <unk> obeying the order , the three harpooneers now stood with the detached iron part of their harpoons , some three feet long , held , barbs up , before him .
“ <unk> me not with that keen steel !
<unk> them ; <unk> them over !
know ye not the <unk> end ?
Turn up the socket !
So , so ; now , ye <unk> , advance .
The irons !
take them ; hold them while I fill ! ” <unk> , slowly going from one officer to the other , he <unk> the harpoon <unk> with the fiery waters from the pewter .
“ Now , three to three , ye stand .
<unk> the murderous <unk> !
<unk> them , ye who are now made parties to this <unk> <unk> .
Ha !
Starbuck !
but the deed is done !
<unk> <unk> sun now <unk> to sit upon it .
<unk> , ye harpooneers !
drink and swear , ye men that man the <unk> <unk> ’ s bow — Death to Moby Dick !
God hunt us all , if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death ! ” The long , barbed steel <unk> were lifted ; and to cries and <unk> against the white whale , the spirits were simultaneously <unk> down with a <unk> .
Starbuck <unk> , and turned , and shivered .
Once more , and finally , the replenished pewter went the <unk> among the frantic crew ; when , waving his free hand to them , they all <unk> ; and Ahab retired within his cabin .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> .
_ The cabin ; by the stern windows ; Ahab sitting alone , and gazing out _ .
I leave a white and <unk> wake ; pale waters , <unk> cheeks , where ’ er I sail .
The <unk> billows sidelong swell to <unk> my track ; let them ; but first I pass .
<unk> , by <unk> <unk> ’ s <unk> , the warm waves <unk> like wine .
The gold brow <unk> the blue .
The <unk> sun — slow dived from noon — goes down ; my soul mounts up !
she <unk> with her endless hill .
Is , then , the crown too heavy that I wear ?
this <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
Yet is it bright with many a <unk> ; I the <unk> , see not its far <unk> ; but <unk> feel that I wear that , that <unk> <unk> .
’ Tis iron — that I know — not gold .
’ Tis split , too — that I feel ; the <unk> edge <unk> me so , my brain seems to beat against the solid <unk> ; aye , steel skull , mine ; the sort that needs no <unk> in the most <unk> fight !
<unk> heat upon my brow ?
Oh !
time was , when as the sunrise <unk> <unk> me , so the sunset <unk> .
No more .
This lovely light , it lights not me ; all <unk> is anguish to me , since I can <unk> ’ er enjoy .

damned in the midst of Paradise !
Good night — good night !
( _ waving his hand , he <unk> from the window _ . )
’ <unk> not so hard a task .
I thought to find one stubborn , at the least ; but my one <unk> circle fits into all their various <unk> , and they <unk> .

CHAPTER <unk> .
Moby Dick .
I , Ishmael , was one of that crew ; my <unk> had gone up with the rest ; my oath had been welded with theirs ; and <unk> I shouted , and more did I hammer and <unk> my oath , because of the dread in my soul .
A wild , mystical , <unk> feeling was in me ; Ahab ’ s <unk> <unk> seemed mine .
With <unk> ears I learned the history of that murderous monster against whom I and all the others had taken our <unk> of violence and revenge .
For some time past , though at intervals only , the <unk> , <unk> White Whale had <unk> those <unk> seas mostly frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen .
But not all of them knew of his existence ; only a few of them , comparatively , had <unk> seen him ; while the number who as yet had actually and <unk> given battle to him , was small indeed .
For , owing to the large number of <unk> ; the <unk> way they were <unk> over the entire watery circumference , many of them <unk> pushing their quest along solitary latitudes , so as seldom or never for a whole <unk> or more on a stretch , to encounter a single <unk> sail of any sort ; the <unk> length of each separate voyage ; the <unk> of the times of sailing from home ; all these , with other circumstances , direct and <unk> , long <unk> the spread through the whole <unk> <unk> of the special <unk> <unk> concerning Moby Dick .
It was hardly to be doubted , that several vessels reported to have encountered , at such or such a time , or on such or such a <unk> , a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and <unk> , which whale , after doing great <unk> to his <unk> , had completely escaped them ; to some minds it was not an <unk> <unk> , I say , that the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick .
Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not <unk> instances of great ferocity , cunning , and malice in the monster attacked ; therefore it was , that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick ; such hunters , perhaps , for the most part , were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred , more , as it were , to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large , than to the individual cause .
In that way , mostly , the <unk> encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded .
And as for those who , previously hearing of the White Whale , by chance caught sight of him ; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them , almost , as boldly and <unk> lowered for him , as for any other whale of that species .
But at length , such <unk> did <unk> in these assaults — not <unk> to <unk> wrists and <unk> , broken limbs , or <unk> <unk> — but fatal to the last degree of fatality ; those repeated <unk> <unk> , all <unk> and <unk> their terrors upon Moby Dick ; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters , to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come .
Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to <unk> , and still the more <unk> the true <unk> of these deadly <unk> .
For not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events , — as the smitten tree gives birth to its <unk> ; but , in maritime life , far more than in that of <unk> <unk> , wild rumors <unk> , wherever there is any <unk> reality for them to <unk> to .
And as the sea <unk> the land in this matter , so the whale fishery <unk> every other sort of maritime life , in the <unk> and <unk> of the rumors which sometimes <unk> there .
For not only are whalemen as a body <unk> from that ignorance and <unk> hereditary to all sailors ; but of all sailors , they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is <unk> <unk> in the sea ; face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels , but , hand to jaw , give battle to them .
<unk> , in such remotest waters , that though you sailed a thousand miles , and passed a thousand shores , you would not come to any <unk> <unk> , or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun ; in such latitudes and <unk> , pursuing too such a calling as he does , the whaleman is wrapped by influences all <unk> to make his fancy <unk> with many a mighty birth .
No wonder , then , that ever <unk> volume from the mere <unk> over the <unk> watery spaces , the <unk> rumors of the White Whale did in the end <unk> with themselves all manner of <unk> hints , and <unk> <unk> <unk> of supernatural agencies , which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors <unk> from anything that <unk> appears .
So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike , that few who by those rumors , at least , had heard of the White Whale , few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw .
But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work .
Not even at the present day has the original <unk> of the Sperm Whale , as <unk> distinguished from all other species of the leviathan , died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body .
There are those this day among them , who , though intelligent and <unk> enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale , would perhaps — either from professional <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> a <unk> with the Sperm Whale ; at any rate , there are plenty of whalemen , especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag , who have never <unk> encountered the Sperm Whale , but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is <unk> to the <unk> monster <unk> pursued in the North ; seated on their hatches , these men will <unk> with a <unk> fireside interest and awe , to the wild , strange tales of Southern whaling .
Nor is the <unk> <unk> of the great Sperm Whale anywhere more <unk> comprehended , than on board of those <unk> which <unk> him .
And as if the now <unk> reality of his might had in former <unk> times thrown its shadow before it ; we find some book naturalists — <unk> and <unk> — <unk> the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea , but also to be so <unk> <unk> as continually to be <unk> for human blood .
Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier ’ s , were these or almost similar impressions <unk> .
For in his Natural History , the Baron himself <unk> that at sight of the Sperm Whale , all fish ( sharks included ) are “ struck with the most lively terrors , ” and “ often in the <unk> of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death . ” And however the general experiences in the fishery may <unk> such <unk> as these ; yet in their full <unk> , even to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , the superstitious belief in them is , in some vicissitudes of their vocation , <unk> in the minds of the hunters .
So that <unk> by the rumors and portents concerning him , not a few of the fishermen recalled , in reference to Moby Dick , the earlier days of the Sperm Whale fishery , when it was oftentimes hard to induce long <unk> Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring <unk> ; such men <unk> that <unk> other leviathans might be <unk> pursued , yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man .
That to attempt it , would be <unk> to be torn into a quick <unk> .
On this head , there are some remarkable <unk> that may be <unk> .
Nevertheless , some there were , who even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to Moby Dick ; and a still greater number who , chancing only to hear of him <unk> and vaguely , without the specific <unk> of any certain <unk> , and without superstitious <unk> , were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered .
One of the wild <unk> <unk> to , as at last coming to be linked with the White Whale in the minds of the <unk> inclined , was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was <unk> ; that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time .
Nor , credulous as such minds must have been , was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability .
For as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been <unk> , even to the most <unk> research ; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain , in great part , unaccountable to his pursuers ; and from time to time have <unk> the most curious and <unk> <unk> regarding them , especially concerning the mystic <unk> whereby , after sounding to a great depth , he <unk> himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points .
It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships , and as well a thing placed upon <unk> record years ago by Scoresby , that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific , in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas .
Nor is it to be <unk> , that in some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have <unk> very many days .
Hence , by inference , it has been believed by some whalemen , that the Nor ’ West <unk> , so long a problem to man , was never a problem to the whale .
So that here , in the real living experience of living men , the <unk> related in old times of the inland <unk> mountain in <unk> ( near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the <unk> of ships floated up to the surface ) ; and that still more wonderful story of the <unk> fountain near <unk> ( whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy <unk> by an <unk> passage ) ; these fabulous <unk> are almost fully <unk> by the <unk> of the whalemen .
<unk> into <unk> , then , with such <unk> as these ; and knowing that after repeated , intrepid assaults , the White Whale had escaped alive ; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions ; <unk> Moby Dick not only <unk> , but immortal ( for <unk> is but <unk> in time ) ; that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks , he would still swim away unharmed ; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood , such a sight would be but a ghastly <unk> ; for again in <unk> billows hundreds of leagues away , his <unk> jet would once more be seen .
But even stripped of these supernatural <unk> , there was enough in the earthly make and <unk> character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power .
For , it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales , but , as was elsewhere thrown out — a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead , and a high , <unk> white hump .
These were his <unk> features ; the tokens whereby , even in the <unk> , <unk> seas , he revealed his identity , at a long distance , to those who knew him .
The rest of his body was so <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> with the same shrouded hue , that , in the end , he had gained his <unk> <unk> of the White Whale ; a name , indeed , literally <unk> by his vivid aspect , when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea , leaving a <unk> wake of creamy foam , all <unk> with golden <unk> .
Nor was it his unwonted magnitude , nor his remarkable hue , nor yet his <unk> lower jaw , that so much invested the whale with natural terror , as that <unk> , intelligent <unk> which , according to specific accounts , he had over and over again evinced in his assaults .
More than all , his treacherous <unk> struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else .
For , when swimming before his <unk> pursuers , with every <unk> <unk> of alarm , he had several times been known to turn round suddenly , and , bearing down upon them , either stave their boats to splinters , or drive them back in consternation to their ship .
Already several <unk> had attended his chase .
But though similar <unk> , however little <unk> ashore , were by no means unusual in the fishery ; yet , in most instances , such seemed the White Whale ’ s infernal <unk> of ferocity , that every <unk> or death that he caused , was not wholly regarded as having been <unk> by an <unk> agent .
<unk> , then , to what <unk> of <unk> , distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled , when amid the chips of chewed boats , and the sinking limbs of torn comrades , they swam out of the white <unk> of the whale ’ s direful wrath into the serene , <unk> sunlight , that <unk> on , as if at a birth or a <unk> .
His three boats stove around him , and oars and men both whirling in the <unk> ; one captain , seizing the <unk> from his broken prow , had dashed at the whale , as an <unk> <unk> at his foe , blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the <unk> life of the whale .
That captain was Ahab .
And then it was , that suddenly sweeping his <unk> lower jaw beneath him , Moby Dick had <unk> away Ahab ’ s leg , as a <unk> a blade of grass in the field .
No <unk> Turk , no <unk> <unk> or <unk> , could have smote him with more seeming malice .
<unk> reason was there to doubt , then , that ever since that almost fatal encounter , Ahab had <unk> a wild <unk> against the whale , all the more fell for that in his frantic <unk> he at last came to <unk> with him , not only all his bodily <unk> , but all his intellectual and spiritual <unk> .
The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac <unk> of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them , till they are left living on with half a heart and half a <unk> .
That <unk> <unk> which has been from the beginning ; to whose <unk> even the modern Christians ascribe <unk> of the worlds ; which the ancient <unk> of the east <unk> in their <unk> devil ; — Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them ; but <unk> <unk> its idea to the <unk> white whale , he <unk> himself , all <unk> , against it .
All that most <unk> and <unk> ; all that <unk> up the <unk> of things ; all truth with malice in it ; all that cracks the <unk> and <unk> the brain ; all the subtle <unk> of life and thought ; all evil , to crazy Ahab , were <unk> <unk> , and made <unk> <unk> in Moby Dick .
He piled upon the whale ’ s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down ; and then , as if his chest had been a <unk> , he burst his hot heart ’ s <unk> upon it .
It is not probable that this <unk> in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily <unk> .
Then , in darting at the monster , knife in hand , he had but given loose to a sudden , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ; and when he received the stroke that tore him , he probably but felt the <unk> bodily <unk> , but nothing more .
Yet , when by this <unk> forced to turn towards home , and for long months of days and weeks , Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock , rounding in <unk> winter that dreary , howling Patagonian Cape ; then it was , that his torn body and <unk> soul <unk> into one another ; and so <unk> , made him mad .
That it was only then , on the homeward voyage , after the encounter , that the final <unk> seized him , seems all but certain from the fact that , at intervals during the passage , he was a <unk> <unk> ; and , though <unk> of a leg , yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest , and was moreover <unk> by his delirium , that his mates were forced to <unk> him fast , even there , as he sailed , <unk> in his hammock .
In a <unk> , he swung to the mad <unk> of the <unk> .
And , when running into more sufferable latitudes , the ship , with mild <unk> ’ sails spread , floated across the <unk> <unk> , and , to all appearances , the old man ’ s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells , and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air ; even then , when he bore that firm , collected front , however pale , and issued his calm orders once again ; and his mates <unk> God the direful madness was now gone ; even then , Ahab , in his hidden self , <unk> on .
<unk> madness is oftentimes a cunning and most <unk> thing .
When you think it fled , it may have but become <unk> into some still <unk> form .
Ahab ’ s full <unk> <unk> not , but <unk> contracted ; like the <unk> <unk> , when that noble <unk> <unk> <unk> , but <unk> through the <unk> <unk> .
But , as in his <unk> <unk> , not one jot of Ahab ’ s broad madness had been left behind ; so in that broad madness , not one jot of his great natural <unk> had perished .
That before living agent , now became the living <unk> .
If such a furious <unk> may stand , his special <unk> <unk> his general <unk> , and carried it , and turned all its <unk> <unk> upon its own mad mark ; so that far from having lost his strength , Ahab , to that one end , did now possess a thousand <unk> more potency than ever he had <unk> brought to bear upon any one reasonable object .
This is much ; yet Ahab ’ s larger , darker , deeper part remains <unk> .
But vain to <unk> <unk> , and all truth is profound .
<unk> far down from within the very heart of this <unk> <unk> de <unk> where we here stand — however grand and wonderful , now quit it ; — and take your way , ye <unk> , <unk> souls , to those vast Roman <unk> of <unk> ; where far beneath the <unk> <unk> of man ’ s upper earth , his root of grandeur , his whole awful <unk> sits in <unk> state ; an antique buried beneath <unk> , and <unk> on <unk> !
So with a broken throne , the great gods <unk> that <unk> king ; so like a <unk> , he patient sits , <unk> on his frozen brow the piled <unk> of ages .
<unk> ye down there , ye <unk> , <unk> souls !
question that proud , sad king !
A family likeness !
aye , he did beget ye , ye young <unk> <unk> ; and from your grim <unk> only will the old <unk> come .
Now , in his heart , Ahab had some glimpse of this , namely : all my means are <unk> , my <unk> and my object mad .
Yet without power to kill , or change , or <unk> the fact ; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long <unk> ; in some sort , did still .
But that thing of his <unk> was only subject to his <unk> , not to his will <unk> .
Nevertheless , so well did he succeed in that <unk> , that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last , no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally <unk> , and that to the quick , with the terrible <unk> which had <unk> him .
The report of his <unk> delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause .
And so too , all the added <unk> which always afterwards , to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage , sat <unk> on his brow .
Nor is it so very <unk> , that far from <unk> his <unk> for another whaling voyage , on account of such dark symptoms , the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit , that for those very reasons he was all the better <unk> and set on edge , for a pursuit so full of rage and <unk> as the bloody hunt of whales .
<unk> within and scorched without , with the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of some <unk> idea ; such an one , could he be found , would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all <unk> .
Or , if for any reason thought to be <unk> <unk> for that , yet such an one would seem <unk> competent to cheer and <unk> on his <unk> to the attack .
But be all this as it may , certain it is , that with the mad secret of his <unk> rage bolted up and <unk> in him , Ahab had <unk> sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and <unk> object of hunting the White Whale .
Had any one of his old <unk> on shore but half <unk> of what was lurking in him then , how soon would their aghast and <unk> souls have wrenched the ship from such a <unk> man !
They were bent on <unk> <unk> , the profit to be counted down in dollars from the <unk> .
He was intent on an audacious , <unk> , and supernatural revenge .
Here , then , was this <unk> , <unk> old man , chasing with <unk> a Job ’ s whale round the world , at the head of a crew , too , chiefly made up of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and cannibals — <unk> <unk> also , by the <unk> of mere <unk> virtue or <unk> in Starbuck , the <unk> <unk> of indifference and <unk> in Stubb , and the <unk> <unk> in Flask .
Such a crew , so <unk> , seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge .
How it was that they so <unk> <unk> to the old man ’ s <unk> — by what evil magic their souls were possessed , that at times his hate seemed almost theirs ; the White Whale as much their insufferable foe as his ; how all this came to be — what the White Whale was to them , or how to their unconscious <unk> , also , in some dim , <unk> way , he might have seemed the gliding great <unk> of the seas of life , — all this to explain , would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go .
The subterranean <unk> that works in us all , how can one tell <unk> <unk> his <unk> by the ever <unk> , muffled sound of his pick ?
Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag ?
What <unk> in tow of a <unk> can stand still ?
For one , I gave myself up to the <unk> of the time and the place ; but while yet all <unk> to encounter the whale , could see naught in that brute but the <unk> ill . CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> of the Whale .
What the white whale was to Ahab , has been hinted ; what , at times , he was to me , as yet remains <unk> .
<unk> from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick , which could not but occasionally <unk> in any man ’ s soul some alarm , there was another thought , or rather vague , nameless horror concerning him , which at times by its intensity completely <unk> all the rest ; and yet so mystical and well nigh <unk> was it , that I almost despair of putting it in a <unk> form .
It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things <unk> me .
But how can I hope to explain myself here ; and yet , in some dim , random way , explain myself I must , else all these chapters might be naught .
Though in many natural objects , whiteness <unk> <unk> beauty , as if <unk> some special virtue of its own , as in <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ; and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal <unk> in this hue ; even the barbaric , grand old kings of <unk> placing the title “ Lord of the White <unk> ” above all their other <unk> <unk> of <unk> ; and the modern kings of <unk> <unk> the same snow-white <unk> in the royal <unk> ; and the <unk> flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white <unk> ; and the great <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to <unk> Rome , having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue ; and though this <unk> in it <unk> to the human race itself , giving the white man <unk> <unk> over every dusky tribe ; and though , besides , all this , whiteness has been even made significant of <unk> , for among the <unk> a white stone marked a <unk> day ; and though in other mortal <unk> and <unk> , this same hue is made the <unk> of many touching , noble things — the innocence of <unk> , the <unk> of age ; though among the <unk> Men of America the giving of the white belt of <unk> was the deepest <unk> of honor ; though in many climes , whiteness <unk> the majesty of <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by <unk> <unk> ; though even in the higher mysteries of the most <unk> <unk> it has been made the symbol of the divine <unk> and power ; by the Persian fire <unk> , the white forked flame being held the <unk> on the altar ; and in the Greek <unk> , Great Jove himself being made <unk> in a snow-white bull ; and though to the noble <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the sacred White <unk> was by far the <unk> <unk> of their <unk> , that <unk> , faithful creature being held the <unk> <unk> they could send to the Great <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of their own <unk> ; and though directly from the Latin word for white , all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred <unk> , the <unk> or <unk> , worn beneath the <unk> ; and though among the holy <unk> of the <unk> faith , white is specially employed in the <unk> of the <unk> of our Lord ; though in the <unk> of St. John , white robes are given to the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> stand clothed in white before the great white throne , and the Holy One that <unk> there white like <unk> ; yet for all these <unk> associations , with whatever is sweet , and honorable , and sublime , there yet lurks an <unk> something in the innermost idea of this hue , which strikes more of panic to the soul than that <unk> which <unk> in blood .
This <unk> quality it is , which <unk> the thought of whiteness , when <unk> from more <unk> associations , and <unk> with any object terrible in itself , to <unk> that terror to the furthest <unk> .
<unk> the white bear of the poles , and the white shark of the <unk> ; what but their smooth , <unk> whiteness makes them the <unk> horrors they are ?
That ghastly whiteness it is which <unk> such an <unk> mildness , even more <unk> than terrific , to the dumb <unk> of their aspect .
So that not the <unk> tiger in his <unk> coat can so <unk> courage as the <unk> bear or shark .
* * With reference to the Polar bear , it may possibly be <unk> by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter , that it is not the whiteness , separately regarded , which <unk> the intolerable <unk> of that brute ; for , <unk> , that heightened <unk> , it might be said , only rises from the circumstance , that the <unk> <unk> of the creature stands invested in the <unk> of celestial innocence and love ; and hence , by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds , the Polar bear <unk> us with so unnatural a contrast .
But even <unk> all this to be true ; yet , were it not for the whiteness , you would not have that <unk> terror .
As for the white shark , the white gliding <unk> of repose in that creature , when beheld in his ordinary moods , strangely <unk> with the same quality in the Polar <unk> .
This peculiarity is most <unk> hit by the French in the name they <unk> upon that fish .
The <unk> mass for the dead begins with “ <unk> <unk> ” ( eternal rest ) , whence _ <unk> _ <unk> the mass itself , and any other funeral <unk> .
Now , in allusion to the white , silent <unk> of death in this shark , and the mild <unk> of his habits , the French call him _ <unk> _ .
<unk> thee of the albatross , whence come those clouds of spiritual <unk> and pale dread , in which that white phantom sails in all <unk> ?
Not <unk> first threw that spell ; but God ’ s great , <unk> <unk> , Nature .
* * I remember the first albatross I ever saw .
It was during a prolonged gale , in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas .
From my <unk> watch below , I ascended to the <unk> deck ; and there , dashed upon the main hatches , I saw a regal , <unk> thing of <unk> whiteness , and with a hooked , Roman bill sublime .
At intervals , it arched forth its vast archangel wings , as if to <unk> some holy ark .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> shook it .
Though bodily unharmed , it <unk> cries , as some king ’ s ghost in supernatural <unk> .
Through its <unk> , strange eyes , <unk> I <unk> to secrets which took hold of God .
As <unk> before the angels , I bowed myself ; the white thing was so white , its wings so wide , and in those for ever <unk> waters , I had lost the miserable <unk> memories of traditions and of towns .
Long I gazed at that <unk> of <unk> .
I cannot tell , can only hint , the things that darted through me then .
But at last I <unk> ; and turning , asked a sailor what bird was this .
A <unk> , he replied .
<unk> !
never had heard that name before ; is it <unk> that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore !
never !
But some time after , I learned that <unk> was some seaman ’ s name for albatross .
So that by no possibility could <unk> ’ s wild <unk> have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine , when I saw that bird upon our deck .
For neither had I then read the <unk> , nor knew the bird to be an albatross .
Yet , in saying this , I do but indirectly <unk> a little <unk> the noble <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> .
I assert , then , that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell ; a truth the more evinced in this , that by a <unk> of terms there are birds called grey <unk> ; and these I have frequently seen , but never with such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl .
But how had the mystic thing been caught ?
<unk> it not , and I will tell ; with a treacherous hook and line , as the fowl floated on the sea .
At last the Captain made a <unk> of it ; <unk> a <unk> , leathern <unk> round its neck , with the ship ’ s time and place ; and then <unk> it escape .
But I doubt not , that leathern <unk> , meant for man , was taken off in Heaven , when the white fowl flew to join the <unk> , the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> !
Most famous in our <unk> <unk> and Indian traditions is that of the White <unk> of the <unk> ; a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and with the dignity of a thousand <unk> in his lofty , <unk> <unk> .
He was the <unk> <unk> of vast herds of wild horses , whose <unk> in those days were only <unk> by the <unk> Mountains and the <unk> .
At their flaming head he <unk> <unk> it like that <unk> <unk> which every evening <unk> on the <unk> of light .
The flashing <unk> of his <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of his tail , invested him with <unk> more <unk> than gold and <unk> could have furnished him .
A most imperial and <unk> apparition of that <unk> , western world , which to the eyes of the old <unk> and hunters <unk> the <unk> of those <unk> times when Adam walked majestic as a god , <unk> and fearless as this mighty steed .
Whether marching amid his <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of countless <unk> that <unk> <unk> it over the <unk> , like an <unk> ; or whether with his <unk> subjects <unk> all around at the horizon , the White <unk> <unk> <unk> them with warm nostrils <unk> through his cool <unk> ; in whatever aspect he presented himself , always to the <unk> Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe .
Nor can it be <unk> from what stands on <unk> record of this noble horse , that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly , which so clothed him with <unk> ; and that this <unk> had that in it which , though commanding worship , at the same time <unk> a certain nameless terror .
But there are other instances where this whiteness <unk> all that <unk> and strange glory which invests it in the White <unk> and Albatross .
What is it that in the <unk> man so peculiarly <unk> and often <unk> the eye , as that sometimes he is <unk> by his own <unk> and <unk> !
It is that whiteness which invests him , a thing expressed by the name he bears .
The <unk> is as well made as other men — has no <unk> <unk> — and yet this mere aspect of <unk> whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the <unk> <unk> .
Why should this be so ?
Nor , in quite other aspects , does Nature in her least <unk> but not the less malicious agencies , fail to <unk> among her <unk> this <unk> <unk> of the terrible .
From its snowy aspect , the <unk> ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White <unk> .
Nor , in some <unk> instances , has the art of human malice omitted so potent an <unk> .
How wildly it <unk> the effect of that passage in <unk> , when , <unk> in the snowy symbol of their <unk> , the desperate White <unk> of <unk> murder their <unk> in the <unk> !
Nor , in some things , does the common , hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear <unk> to the <unk> of this hue .
It cannot well be doubted , that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most <unk> the <unk> , is the marble pallor lingering there ; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the <unk> of consternation in the other world , as of mortal <unk> here .
And from that pallor of the dead , we <unk> the <unk> hue of the shroud in which we <unk> them .
Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy <unk> round our phantoms ; all ghosts rising in a <unk> <unk> — Yea , while these terrors seize us , let us add , that even the king of terrors , when <unk> by the <unk> , <unk> on his <unk> horse .
Therefore , in his other moods , <unk> whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness , no man can deny that in its profoundest <unk> significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul .
But though without <unk> this point be fixed , how is mortal man to account for it ?
To <unk> it , would seem impossible .
Can we , then , by the <unk> of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness — though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to <unk> to it aught fearful , but nevertheless , is found to <unk> over us the same <unk> , however modified ; — can we thus hope to light upon some chance <unk> to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek ?
Let us try .
But in a matter like this , <unk> <unk> to <unk> , and without imagination no man can follow another into these <unk> .
And though , doubtless , some at least of the <unk> impressions about to be presented may have been <unk> by most men , yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time , and therefore may not be able to recall them now .
Why to the man of untutored <unk> , who happens to be but <unk> acquainted with the peculiar character of the day , does the bare mention of <unk> <unk> in the fancy such long , dreary , speechless <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> and hooded with <unk> snow ?
Or , to the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the <unk> American States , why does the passing mention of a White <unk> or a White <unk> , <unk> such an <unk> <unk> in the soul ?
Or what is there apart from the traditions of <unk> <unk> and kings ( which will not wholly account for it ) that makes the White <unk> of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an <unk> American , than those other <unk> <unk> , its <unk> — the <unk> <unk> , or even the <unk> ?
And those <unk> <unk> , the White Mountains of New <unk> , whence , in peculiar moods , comes that gigantic <unk> over the soul at the bare mention of that name , while the thought of Virginia ’ s <unk> <unk> is full of a soft , <unk> , distant <unk> ?
Or why , <unk> of all latitudes and <unk> , does the name of the White Sea <unk> such a <unk> over the fancy , while that of the <unk> Sea <unk> us with mortal thoughts of long <unk> mild <unk> on the waves , followed by the <unk> and yet <unk> of <unk> ?
Or , to choose a wholly <unk> instance , <unk> addressed to the fancy , why , in reading the old <unk> tales of <unk> Europe , does “ the tall pale man ” of the <unk> forests , whose <unk> pallor <unk> <unk> through the green of the groves — why is this phantom more terrible than all the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> ?
Nor is it , altogether , the <unk> of her <unk> <unk> ; nor the <unk> of her frantic seas ; nor the <unk> of <unk> skies that never rain ; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires , wrenched <unk> , and <unk> all <unk> ( like <unk> yards of <unk> <unk> ) ; and her <unk> <unk> of <unk> lying over upon each other , as a tossed pack of <unk> ; — it is not these things alone which make <unk> Lima , the <unk> , <unk> city thou can ’ st see .
For Lima has taken the white veil ; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe .
Old as <unk> , this whiteness keeps her <unk> for ever new ; <unk> not the cheerful <unk> of complete <unk> ; <unk> over her broken <unk> the <unk> pallor of an <unk> that <unk> its own <unk> .
I know that , to the common apprehension , this phenomenon of whiteness is not <unk> to be the prime agent in <unk> the terror of objects otherwise terrible ; nor to the <unk> mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose <unk> to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon , especially when <unk> under any form at all approaching to <unk> or <unk> .
What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be <unk> <unk> by the following <unk> .
First : The mariner , when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands , if by night he hear the roar of breakers , <unk> to vigilance , and feels just enough of <unk> to <unk> all his <unk> ; but under precisely similar circumstances , let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness — as if from <unk> <unk> shoals of <unk> white bears were swimming round him , then he feels a silent , superstitious dread ; the shrouded phantom of the <unk> waters is horrible to him as a real ghost ; in vain the lead <unk> him he is still off soundings ; heart and helm they both go down ; he never <unk> till blue water is under him again .
Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee , “ Sir , it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks , as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me ? ” Second : To the native Indian of Peru , the continual sight of the <unk> Andes <unk> naught of dread , except , perhaps , in the mere <unk> of the eternal <unk> <unk> <unk> at such vast <unk> , and the natural conceit of what a <unk> it would be to lose <unk> in such <unk> <unk> .
Much the same is it with the <unk> of the West , who with comparative indifference <unk> an <unk> prairie <unk> with driven snow , no shadow of tree or <unk> to break the fixed trance of whiteness .
Not so the sailor , beholding the <unk> of the Antarctic seas ; where at times , by some infernal trick of <unk> in the powers of frost and air , he , shivering and half <unk> , instead of <unk> speaking hope and <unk> to his <unk> , <unk> what seems a boundless <unk> grinning upon him with its lean ice <unk> and splintered <unk> .
But thou <unk> , <unk> that <unk> chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul ; thou <unk> to a <unk> , Ishmael .
Tell me , why this strong young colt , <unk> in some peaceful valley of <unk> , far removed from all beasts of prey — why is it that upon the <unk> day , if you but shake a fresh buffalo <unk> behind him , so that he cannot even see it , but only smells its wild animal <unk> — why will he start , <unk> , and with bursting eyes <unk> the ground in <unk> of <unk> ?
There is no <unk> in him of any <unk> of wild creatures in his green northern home , so that the strange <unk> he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils ; for what knows he , this New England colt , of the black <unk> of distant <unk> ?
No : but here thou <unk> even in a dumb brute , the instinct of the knowledge of the <unk> in the world .
Though thousands of miles from <unk> , still when he smells that savage musk , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> herds are as present as to the deserted wild <unk> of the <unk> , which this instant they may be <unk> into dust .
Thus , then , the muffled <unk> of a milky sea ; the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of mountains ; the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> ; all these , to Ishmael , are as the shaking of that buffalo <unk> to the frightened colt !
Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints ; yet with me , as with the colt , somewhere those things must <unk> .
Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in love , the invisible <unk> were formed in fright .
But not yet have we <unk> the <unk> of this whiteness , and learned why it <unk> with such power to the soul ; and more strange and far more portentous — why , as we have seen , it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things , nay , the very veil of the Christian ’ s <unk> ; and yet should be as it is , the <unk> agent in things the most appalling to mankind .
Is it that by its <unk> it shadows forth the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the universe , and thus <unk> us from behind with the thought of <unk> , when beholding the white depths of the milky way ?
Or is it , that as in <unk> whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour ; and at the same time the <unk> of all colours ; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb <unk> , full of meaning , in a wide <unk> of <unk> — a <unk> , <unk> of <unk> from which we <unk> ?
And when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers , that all other earthly <unk> — every stately or lovely <unk> — the sweet <unk> of sunset skies and woods ; yea , and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> cheeks of young girls ; all these are but <unk> <unk> , not actually <unk> in <unk> , but only laid on from without ; so that all <unk> Nature <unk> <unk> like the <unk> , whose <unk> cover nothing but the <unk> within ; and when we proceed further , and consider that the mystical <unk> which <unk> every one of her <unk> , the great principle of light , for ever remains white or <unk> in itself , and if <unk> without medium upon matter , would touch all objects , even <unk> and roses , with its own blank <unk> — pondering all this , the <unk> universe lies before us a <unk> ; and like wilful <unk> in <unk> , who refuse to wear <unk> and <unk> glasses upon their eyes , so the wretched infidel <unk> himself blind at the <unk> white shroud that <unk> all the prospect around him .
And of all these things the <unk> whale was the symbol .
<unk> ye then at the fiery hunt ?
CHAPTER <unk> .
Hark !
“ <unk> !
Did you hear that noise , Cabaco ? ” It was the <unk> : a fair moonlight ; the seamen were standing in a <unk> , extending from one of the <unk> butts in the waist , to the <unk> near the taffrail .
In this manner , they passed the <unk> to fill the <unk> .
Standing , for the most part , on the <unk> <unk> of the quarter-deck , they were careful not to speak or <unk> their feet .
From hand to hand , the <unk> went in the deepest silence , only broken by the occasional <unk> of a sail , and the steady hum of the <unk> advancing keel .
It was in the midst of this repose , that Archy , one of the <unk> , whose post was near the <unk> , whispered to his <unk> , a <unk> , the words above .
“ Hist !
did you hear that noise , Cabaco ? ” “ Take the bucket , will ye , Archy ?
what noise d ’ ye mean ? ” “ There it is again — under the hatches — don ’ t you hear it — a <unk> — it sounded like a <unk> . ” “ <unk> be damned !
<unk> along that return bucket . ” “ There again — there it is ! — it sounds like two or three sleepers turning over , now ! ” “ <unk> !
have done , shipmate , will ye ?
It ’ s the three <unk> <unk> ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye — nothing else .
Look to the bucket ! ” “ Say what ye will , shipmate ; I ’ ve sharp ears . ” “ Aye , you are the chap , ain ’ t ye , that heard the hum of the old <unk> ’ s <unk> fifty miles at sea from Nantucket ; you ’ re the chap . ” “ <unk> away ; we ’ ll see what turns up .
Hark ye , Cabaco , there is somebody down in the <unk> that has not yet been seen on deck ; and I <unk> our old Mogul knows something of it too .
I heard Stubb tell Flask , one morning watch , that there was something of that sort in the wind . ” “ <unk> !
the bucket ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night <unk> that wild <unk> of his purpose with his crew , you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom , and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of <unk> sea charts , spread them before him on his <unk> table .
Then <unk> himself before it , you would have seen him intently study the various lines and <unk> which there met his eye ; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank .
At intervals , he would <unk> to <unk> of old <unk> beside him , wherein were set down the seasons and places in which , on various former voyages of various ships , sperm whales had been captured or seen .
While thus employed , the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head , continually rocked with the motion of the ship , and for ever threw <unk> gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow , till it almost seemed that while he himself was <unk> out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts , some invisible pencil was also <unk> lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead .
But it was not this night in particular that , in the <unk> of his cabin , Ahab thus pondered over his charts .
Almost every night they were brought out ; almost every night some pencil marks were <unk> , and others were <unk> .
For with the charts of all four oceans before him , Ahab was <unk> a <unk> of currents and <unk> , with a view to the more certain <unk> of that monomaniac thought of his soul .
Now , to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans , it might seem an <unk> hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the <unk> oceans of this <unk> .
But not so did it seem to Ahab , who knew the sets of all tides and currents ; and thereby calculating the <unk> of the sperm whale ’ s food ; and , also , calling to mind the regular , <unk> seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes ; could arrive at reasonable <unk> , almost approaching to <unk> , concerning the <unk> day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey .
So assured , indeed , is the fact concerning the <unk> of the sperm whale ’ s <unk> to given waters , that many hunters believe that , could he be closely observed and <unk> throughout the world ; were the <unk> for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully <unk> , then the <unk> of the sperm whale would be found to <unk> in <unk> to those of the <unk> or the <unk> of <unk> .
On this hint , attempts have been made to <unk> <unk> <unk> charts of the sperm whale .
* * <unk> the above was written , the <unk> is happily borne out by an official circular , issued by <unk> <unk> , of the <unk> <unk> , Washington , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
By that circular , it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of <unk> ; and <unk> of it are presented in the circular .
“ This chart <unk> the ocean into <unk> of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude ; perpendicularly through each of which <unk> are twelve <unk> for the twelve months ; and horizontally through each of which <unk> are three lines ; one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every <unk> , and the two others to show the number of days in which whales , sperm or right , have been seen . ” Besides , when making a passage from one <unk> to another , the sperm whales , <unk> by some infallible instinct — say , rather , secret intelligence from the <unk> — mostly swim in _ veins _ , as they are called ; <unk> their way along a given <unk> with such undeviating <unk> , that no ship ever sailed her course , by any chart , with one <unk> of such marvellous <unk> .
Though , in these cases , the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a <unk> ’ s parallel , and though the line of advance be strictly <unk> to its own <unk> , straight wake , yet the <unk> _ <unk> _ in which at these times he is said to swim , generally embraces some few miles in <unk> ( more or less , as the <unk> is presumed to expand or <unk> ) ; but never <unk> the <unk> sweep from the whale-ship ’ s mast-heads , when <unk> gliding along this magic zone .
The sum is , that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that path , <unk> whales may with great confidence be looked for .
And hence not only at <unk> times , upon well known separate <unk> , could Ahab hope to encounter his prey ; but in crossing the <unk> <unk> of water between those grounds he could , by his art , so place and time himself on his way , as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting .
There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to <unk> his <unk> but still <unk> <unk> .
But not so in the reality , perhaps .
Though the <unk> sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds , yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which <unk> such and such a latitude or longitude this year , say , will turn out to be <unk> the same with those that were found there the preceding season ; though there are peculiar and <unk> instances where the contrary of this has proved true .
In general , the same <unk> , only within a less wide limit , <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> among the <unk> , aged sperm whales .
So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen , for example , on what is called the <unk> ground in the Indian ocean , or <unk> <unk> on the Japanese <unk> ; yet it did not follow , that were the Pequod to visit either of those <unk> at any subsequent corresponding season , she would infallibly encounter him there .
So , too , with some other feeding grounds , where he had at times revealed himself .
But all these seemed only his <unk> <unk> and <unk> , so to speak , not his places of prolonged <unk> .
And where Ahab ’ s chances of <unk> his object have hitherto been spoken of , allusion has only been made to whatever <unk> , <unk> , extra <unk> were his , ere a particular set time or place were <unk> , when all <unk> would become <unk> , and , as Ahab <unk> thought , every possibility the next thing to a <unk> .
That particular set time and place were <unk> in the one <unk> phrase — the <unk> .
For there and then , for several <unk> years , Moby Dick had been <unk> descried , lingering in those waters for awhile , as the sun , in its <unk> round , <unk> for a <unk> interval in any one sign of the <unk> .
There it was , too , that most of the deadly <unk> with the white whale had taken place ; there the waves were <unk> with his <unk> ; there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful <unk> to his vengeance .
But in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> vigilance with which Ahab threw his <unk> soul into this <unk> hunt , he would not <unk> himself to rest all his <unk> upon the one <unk> fact above mentioned , however <unk> it might be to those <unk> ; nor in the <unk> of his vow could he so <unk> his <unk> heart as to <unk> all <unk> quest .
Now , the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the <unk> .
No possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage <unk> , double Cape Horn , and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there .
Therefore , he must wait for the next <unk> season .
Yet the <unk> hour of the Pequod ’ s sailing had , perhaps , been correctly <unk> by Ahab , with a view to this very complexion of things .
Because , an interval of three hundred and <unk> days and nights was before him ; an interval which , instead of <unk> <unk> ashore , he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt ; if by chance the White Whale , spending his <unk> in seas far remote from his <unk> <unk> , should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian <unk> , or in the <unk> <unk> , or China Seas , or in any other waters <unk> by his race .
So that <unk> , <unk> , Nor ’ <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ; any wind but the <unk> and <unk> , might blow Moby Dick into the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the Pequod ’ s <unk> wake .
But <unk> all this ; yet , regarded <unk> and coolly , seems it not but a mad idea , this ; that in the broad boundless ocean , one solitary whale , even if encountered , should be thought capable of individual <unk> from his hunter , even as a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> ?
Yes .
For the peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick , and his snow-white hump , could not but be <unk> .
And have I not <unk> the whale , Ahab would <unk> to himself , as after <unk> over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries — <unk> him , and shall he escape ?
His broad fins are <unk> , and <unk> out like a lost <unk> ’ s ear !
And here , his mad mind would run on in a <unk> race ; till a <unk> and <unk> of pondering came over him ; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to <unk> his strength .
Ah , God !
what <unk> of <unk> does that man endure who is consumed with one <unk> <unk> desire .
He sleeps with clenched hands ; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms .
Often , when forced from his hammock by <unk> and <unk> vivid dreams of the night , which , resuming his own intense thoughts through the day , carried them on amid a <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> them round and round and round in his blazing brain , till the very <unk> of his <unk> became insufferable anguish ; and when , as was sometimes the case , these spiritual <unk> in him heaved his being up from its base , and a <unk> seemed opening in him , from which forked flames and <unk> shot up , and accursed fiends <unk> him to leap down among them ; when this hell in himself <unk> beneath him , a wild cry would be heard through the ship ; and with <unk> eyes Ahab would burst from his state room , as though <unk> from a bed that was on fire .
Yet these , perhaps , instead of being the <unk> symptoms of some latent <unk> , or fright at his own <unk> , were but the <unk> tokens of its intensity .
For , at such times , crazy Ahab , the <unk> , <unk> steadfast hunter of the white whale ; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock , was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again .
The latter was the eternal , living principle or soul in him ; and in sleep , being for the time <unk> from the <unk> mind , which at other times employed it for its outer <unk> or agent , it <unk> sought escape from the scorching <unk> of the frantic thing , of which , for the time , it was no longer an <unk> .
But as the mind does not <unk> unless <unk> with the soul , therefore it must have been that , in Ahab ’ s case , <unk> up all his thoughts and <unk> to his one <unk> purpose ; that purpose , by its own <unk> <unk> of will , forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of <unk> , independent being of its own .
Nay , could grimly live and burn , while the common vitality to which it was <unk> , fled <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> birth .
Therefore , the tormented spirit that <unk> out of bodily eyes , when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room , was for the time but a <unk> thing , a <unk> <unk> being , a <unk> of living light , to be sure , but without an object to colour , and therefore a <unk> in itself .
God help thee , old man , thy thoughts have created a creature in thee ; and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a <unk> ; a <unk> feeds upon that heart for ever ; that <unk> the very creature he <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book ; and , indeed , as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales , the <unk> chapter , in its earlier part , is as important a one as will be found in this volume ; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly <unk> upon , in order to be adequately <unk> , and moreover to take away any <unk> which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds , as to the natural <unk> of the main points of this affair .
I care not to perform this part of my task <unk> ; but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate <unk> of items , <unk> or <unk> known to me as a whaleman ; and from these <unk> , I take it — the conclusion <unk> at will naturally follow of itself .
First : I have personally known three instances where a whale , after receiving a harpoon , has <unk> a complete escape ; and , after an interval ( in one instance of three years ) , has been again struck by the same hand , and slain ; when the two irons , both marked by the same private <unk> , have been taken from the body .
In the instance where three years <unk> between the flinging of the two harpoons ; and I think it may have been something more than that ; the man who darted them happening , in the interval , to go in a <unk> ship on a voyage to Africa , went ashore there , joined a discovery party , and <unk> far into the interior , where he <unk> for a period of nearly two years , often <unk> by <unk> , savages , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , with all the other common perils incident to <unk> in the heart of unknown <unk> .
Meanwhile , the whale he had struck must also have been on its <unk> ; no doubt it had thrice <unk> the globe , <unk> with its flanks all the coasts of Africa ; but to no purpose .
This man and this whale again came together , and the one <unk> the other .
I say I , myself , have known three instances similar to this ; that is in two of them I saw the whales struck ; and , upon the second attack , saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them , afterwards taken from the dead fish .
In the <unk> instance , it so fell out that I was in the boat both times , first and last , and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge <unk> under the whale ’ s eye , which I had observed there three years previous .
I say three years , but I am pretty sure it was more than that .
Here are three instances , then , which I personally know the truth of ; but I have heard of many other instances from persons whose <unk> in the matter there is no good ground to <unk> .
<unk> : It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery , however ignorant the world ashore may be of it , that there have been several <unk> historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly <unk> .
Why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales ; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be , they soon put an end to his peculiarities by <unk> him , and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil .
No : the reason was this : that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible <unk> of <unk> about such a whale as there did about <unk> <unk> , <unk> that most fishermen were content to <unk> him by merely touching their <unk> when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea , without seeking to <unk> a more <unk> <unk> .
Like some poor devils ashore that happen to know an <unk> great man , they make distant <unk> <unk> to him in the street , lest if they pursued the <unk> further , they might receive a <unk> thump for their <unk> .
But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual <unk> — Nay , you may call it an <unk> <unk> ; not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death , but he was <unk> into all the rights , <unk> , and <unk> of a name ; had as much a name indeed as <unk> or <unk> .
Was it not so , O <unk> <unk> !
thou <unk> leviathan , <unk> like an iceberg , who so long did ’ st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name , whose spout was <unk> seen from the <unk> beach of <unk> ?
Was it not so , O New Zealand <unk> !
thou terror of all <unk> that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the <unk> <unk> ?
Was it not so , O <unk> !
King of Japan , whose lofty jet they say at times <unk> the <unk> of a snow-white cross against the sky ?
Was it not so , O Don <unk> !
thou <unk> whale , marked like an old <unk> with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back !
In plain <unk> , here are four whales as well known to the <unk> of <unk> History as <unk> or <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
But this is not all .
New Zealand <unk> and Don <unk> , after at various times <unk> great <unk> among the boats of different vessels , were finally gone in quest of , <unk> hunted out , chased and killed by valiant whaling captains , who heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view , as in setting out through the <unk> <unk> , Captain <unk> of old had it in his mind to capture that <unk> murderous savage <unk> , the <unk> warrior of the Indian King <unk> .
I do not know where I can find a better place than just here , to make mention of one or two other things , which to me seem important , as in <unk> form <unk> in all respects the <unk> of the whole story of the White Whale , more especially the <unk> .
For this is one of those <unk> instances where truth requires full as much <unk> as <unk> .
So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the <unk> and most <unk> wonders of the world , that without some hints touching the plain facts , historical and otherwise , of the fishery , they might <unk> at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable , or still worse and more <unk> , a hideous and intolerable <unk> .
First : Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of the grand fishery , yet they have nothing like a fixed , vivid <unk> of those perils , and the <unk> with which they <unk> .
One reason perhaps is , that not one in fifty of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> by <unk> in the fishery , ever finds a public record at home , however <unk> and immediately forgotten that record .
Do you suppose that that poor fellow there , who this moment perhaps caught by the whale-line off the coast of New <unk> , is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan — do you suppose that that poor fellow ’ s name will appear in the <unk> <unk> you will read to-morrow at your breakfast ?
No : because the <unk> are very irregular between here and New <unk> .
In fact , did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or <unk> from New <unk> ?
Yet I tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific , among many others we spoke thirty different ships , every one of which had had a death by a whale , some of them more than one , and three that had each lost a boat ’ s crew .
For God ’ s sake , be <unk> with your lamps and candles !
not a <unk> you burn , but at least one drop of man ’ s blood was spilled for it .
<unk> : People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power ; but I have ever found that when <unk> to them some specific example of this <unk> <unk> , they have <unk> <unk> me upon my <unk> ; when , I declare upon my soul , I had no more idea of being <unk> than <unk> , when he <unk> the history of the <unk> of <unk> .
But <unk> the special point I here seek can be <unk> upon <unk> entirely independent of my own .
That point is this : The Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently <unk> , knowing , and <unk> malicious , as with direct <unk> to stave in , utterly destroy , and sink a large ship ; and what is more , the Sperm Whale _ has _ done it .
First : In the year <unk> the ship <unk> , Captain <unk> , of Nantucket , was cruising in the Pacific Ocean .
One day she saw spouts , lowered her boats , and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales .
Ere long , several of the whales were wounded ; when , suddenly , a very large whale <unk> from the boats , issued from the shoal , and bore directly down upon the ship .
<unk> his forehead against her hull , he so stove her in , that in less than “ ten minutes ” she settled down and fell over .
Not a <unk> plank of her has been seen since .
After the <unk> <unk> , part of the crew reached the land in their boats .
Being returned home at last , Captain <unk> once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship , but the gods <unk> him again upon unknown rocks and breakers ; for the second time his ship was utterly lost , and <unk> <unk> the sea , he has never <unk> it since .
At this day Captain <unk> is a <unk> of Nantucket .
I have seen Owen Chace , who was chief mate of the <unk> at the time of the <unk> ; I have read his plain and faithful narrative ; I have <unk> with his son ; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the <unk> .
* * The following are extracts from Chace ’ s narrative : “ Every fact seemed to <unk> me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his <unk> ; he made two several <unk> upon the ship , at a short interval between them , both of which , according to their direction , were calculated to do us the most <unk> , by being made ahead , and thereby <unk> the speed of the two objects for the shock ; to effect which , the exact <unk> which he made were necessary .
His aspect was most horrible , and such as <unk> <unk> and fury .
He came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered , and in which we had struck three of his companions , as if <unk> with revenge for their <unk> . ” Again : “ At all events , the whole circumstances taken together , all happening before my own eyes , and producing , at the time , impressions in my mind of decided , calculating <unk> , on the part of the whale ( many of which impressions I cannot now recall ) , induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion . ” Here are his reflections some time after <unk> the ship , during a black night in an open boat , when almost <unk> of reaching any hospitable shore .
“ The dark ocean and <unk> waters were nothing ; the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest , or dashed upon hidden rocks , with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful <unk> , seemed scarcely entitled to a moment ’ s thought ; the dismal looking wreck , and _ the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale _ , wholly <unk> my reflections , until day again made its appearance . ” In another place — <unk> .
<unk> , — he <unk> of “ _ the mysterious and mortal attack of the animal _ . ” <unk> : The ship <unk> , also of Nantucket , was in the year <unk> <unk> lost off the <unk> by a similar onset , but the <unk> particulars of this <unk> I have never chanced to encounter , though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard <unk> allusions to it .
<unk> : Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore <unk> — — , then commanding an American <unk> of the first <unk> , happened to be <unk> with a party of whaling captains , on board a Nantucket ship in the harbor of <unk> , <unk> Islands .
<unk> turning upon whales , the Commodore was pleased to be <unk> touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present .
He <unk> <unk> for example , that any whale could so <unk> his stout <unk> as to cause her to leak so much as a <unk> .
Very good ; but there is more coming .
Some weeks after , the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for <unk> .
But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale , that begged a few moments ’ confidential business with him .
That business <unk> in fetching the Commodore ’ s craft such a <unk> , that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and <unk> .
I am not superstitious , but I consider the Commodore ’ s <unk> with that whale as <unk> .
Was not <unk> of <unk> converted from <unk> by a similar fright ?
I tell you , the sperm whale will stand no nonsense .
I will now <unk> you to Langsdorff ’ s Voyages for a little circumstance in point , peculiarly interesting to the <unk> <unk> .
Langsdorff , you must know by the way , was attached to the <unk> <unk> <unk> ’ s famous <unk> <unk> in the beginning of the present century .
Captain Langsdorff thus begins his <unk> chapter : “ By the <unk> of May our ship was ready to sail , and the next day we were out in the open sea , on our way to <unk> .
The weather was very clear and fine , but so <unk> cold that we were obliged to keep on our <unk> <unk> .
For some days we had very little wind ; it was not till the <unk> that a brisk gale from the <unk> sprang up .
An uncommon large whale , the body of which was larger than the ship itself , lay almost at the surface of the water , but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship , which was in full sail , was almost upon him , so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him .
We were thus placed in the most imminent danger , as this gigantic creature , setting up its back , raised the ship three feet at least out of the water .
The masts reeled , and the sails fell altogether , while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck , concluding that we had struck upon some rock ; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost <unk> and <unk> .
Captain D ’ <unk> applied immediately to the pumps to <unk> whether or not the vessel had received any <unk> from the shock , but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely <unk> . ” Now , the Captain D ’ <unk> here alluded to as commanding the ship in question , is a New <unk> , who , after a long life of unusual adventures as a <unk> , this day <unk> in the village of <unk> near <unk> .
I have the honor of being a <unk> of his .
I have particularly <unk> him concerning this passage in Langsdorff .
He <unk> every word .
The ship , however , was by no means a large one : a <unk> craft built on the <unk> coast , and <unk> by my <unk> after <unk> away the vessel in which he sailed from home .
In that up and down <unk> book of old-fashioned adventure , so full , too , of honest wonders — the voyage of <unk> <unk> , one of ancient <unk> ’ s old <unk> — I found a little matter set down so like that just <unk> from Langsdorff , that I cannot <unk> <unk> it here for a <unk> example , if such be needed .
<unk> , it seems , was on his way to “ John <unk> , ” as he calls the modern <unk> <unk> .
“ In our way thither , ” he says , “ about four o ’ clock in the morning , when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the <unk> of America , our ship felt a terrible shock , which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think ; but every one began to <unk> for death .
And , indeed , the shock was so sudden and violent , that we took it for <unk> the ship had struck against a rock ; but when the amazement was a little over , we cast the lead , and sounded , but found no ground .
* * * * * The <unk> of the shock made the <unk> leap in their <unk> , and several of the men were <unk> out of their <unk> .
Captain <unk> , who lay with his head on a gun , was thrown out of his cabin ! ” <unk> then goes on to <unk> the shock to an <unk> , and seems to <unk> the <unk> by <unk> that a great <unk> , somewhere about that time , did actually do great <unk> along the Spanish land .
But I should not much wonder if , in the darkness of that early hour of the morning , the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale <unk> <unk> the hull from beneath .
I might proceed with several more <unk> , one way or another known to me , of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale .
In more than one instance , he has been known , not only to chase the <unk> boats back to their ships , but to <unk> the ship itself , and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks .
The English ship <unk> <unk> can tell a story on that head ; and , as for his strength , let me say , that there have been <unk> where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have , in a calm , been <unk> to the ship , and secured there ; the whale towing her great hull through the water , as a horse <unk> off with a <unk> .
Again , it is very often observed that , if the sperm whale , once struck , is allowed time to <unk> , he then <unk> , not so often with blind rage , as with wilful , deliberate <unk> of destruction to his pursuers ; nor is it without <unk> some <unk> <unk> of his character , that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth , and retain it in that dread <unk> for several <unk> minutes .
But I must be content with only one more and a concluding <unk> ; a remarkable and most significant one , by which you will not fail to see , that not only is the most marvellous event in this book <unk> by plain facts of the present day , but that these marvels ( like all marvels ) are mere <unk> of the ages ; so that for the <unk> time we say <unk> with Solomon — <unk> there is nothing new under the sun .
In the <unk> Christian century lived <unk> , a Christian <unk> of <unk> , in the days when <unk> was <unk> and <unk> general .
As many know , he <unk> the history of his own times , a work every way of uncommon value .
By the best authorities , he has always been considered a most <unk> and <unk> <unk> , except in some one or two particulars , not at all <unk> the matter presently to be mentioned .
Now , in this history of his , <unk> <unk> that , during the term of his <unk> at <unk> , a great <unk> was captured in the neighboring <unk> , or Sea of <unk> , after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years .
A fact thus set down in <unk> history cannot easily be <unk> .
Nor is there any reason it should be .
Of what precise species this <unk> was , is not mentioned .
But as he destroyed ships , as well as for other reasons , he must have been a whale ; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale .
And I will tell you why .
For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters <unk> with it .
Even now I am certain that those seas are not , and perhaps never can be , in the present <unk> of things , a place for his <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But further <unk> have recently proved to me , that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean .
I am told , on good authority , that on the <unk> coast , a Commodore <unk> of the <unk> navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale .
Now , as a vessel of war readily <unk> through the <unk> , hence a sperm whale could , by the same <unk> , pass out of the Mediterranean into the <unk> .
In the <unk> , as far as I can learn , none of that peculiar substance called _ brit _ is to be found , the <unk> of the right whale .
But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale — <unk> or <unk> — lurks at the bottom of that sea , because large creatures , but by no means the largest of that sort , have been found at its surface .
If , then , you properly put these statements together , and reason upon them a bit , you will <unk> perceive that , according to all human <unk> , <unk> ’ s <unk> , that for half a century stove the ships of a Roman <unk> , must in all probability have been a sperm whale .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> .
Though , consumed with the hot fire of his purpose , Ahab in all his thoughts and <unk> ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick ; though he seemed ready to <unk> all mortal <unk> to that one passion ; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long <unk> far too wedded to a fiery whaleman ’ s ways , altogether to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the voyage .
Or at least if this were otherwise , there were not wanting other motives much more <unk> with him .
It would be <unk> too much , perhaps , even considering his <unk> , to hint that his <unk> towards the White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales , and that the more monsters he <unk> by so much the more he <unk> the chances that each <unk> encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted .
But if such an <unk> be indeed <unk> , there were still additional considerations which , though not so strictly according with the <unk> of his <unk> passion , yet were by no means <unk> of swaying him .
To <unk> his object Ahab must use <unk> ; and of all <unk> used in the shadow of the moon , men are most apt to get out of order .
He knew , for example , that however magnetic his <unk> in some respects was over Starbuck , yet that <unk> did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority <unk> intellectual <unk> ; for to the <unk> spiritual , the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal <unk> .
Starbuck ’ s body and Starbuck ’ s <unk> will were Ahab ’ s , so long as Ahab kept his <unk> at Starbuck ’ s brain ; still he knew that for all this the chief mate , in his soul , <unk> his captain ’ s quest , and could he , would <unk> <unk> himself from it , or even <unk> it .
It might be that a long interval would <unk> ere the White Whale was seen .
During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open <unk> of <unk> against his captain ’ s <unk> , unless some ordinary , <unk> , <unk> influences were brought to bear upon him .
Not only that , but the subtle insanity of Ahab <unk> Moby Dick was <unk> more <unk> <unk> than in his <unk> sense and <unk> in <unk> that , for the present , the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange <unk> <unk> which naturally invested it ; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the <unk> <unk> ( for few men ’ s courage is <unk> against <unk> meditation <unk> by action ) ; that when they stood their long night watches , his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick .
For however eagerly and <unk> the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest ; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less <unk> and <unk> — they live in the <unk> outer weather , and they <unk> its <unk> — and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit , however <unk> of life and passion in the end , it is above all things <unk> that temporary <unk> and <unk> should <unk> and hold them <unk> suspended for the final dash .
Nor was Ahab <unk> of another thing .
In times of strong emotion mankind <unk> all base considerations ; but such times are <unk> .
The permanent <unk> condition of the <unk> man , thought Ahab , is <unk> .
<unk> that the White Whale fully <unk> the hearts of this my savage crew , and playing round their <unk> even <unk> a certain generous <unk> in them , still , while for the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick , they must also have food for their more common , daily <unk> .
For even the high lifted and <unk> <unk> of old times were not content to <unk> two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy <unk> , without <unk> <unk> , picking pockets , and gaining other pious <unk> by the way .
Had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object — that final and romantic object , too many would have turned from in <unk> .
I will not strip these men , thought Ahab , of all <unk> of cash — aye , cash .
They may scorn cash now ; but let some months go by , and no <unk> promise of it to them , and then this same <unk> cash all at once <unk> in them , this same cash would soon <unk> Ahab .
Nor was there wanting still another <unk> <unk> more related to Ahab personally .
<unk> <unk> , it is probable , and perhaps somewhat <unk> revealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequod ’ s voyage , Ahab was now entirely conscious that , in so doing , he had indirectly laid himself open to the <unk> charge of <unk> ; and with <unk> <unk> , both <unk> and <unk> , his crew if so <unk> , and to that end competent , could refuse all further obedience to him , and even violently <unk> from him the command .
From even the <unk> hinted <unk> of <unk> , and the possible <unk> of such a <unk> impression gaining ground , Ahab must of course have been most anxious to <unk> himself .
That <unk> could only <unk> in his own <unk> brain and heart and hand , backed by a heedful , closely calculating attention to every minute <unk> influence which it was possible for his crew to be <unk> to .
For all these reasons then , and others perhaps too <unk> to be <unk> <unk> here , Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural , <unk> purpose of the Pequod ’ s voyage ; observe all customary <unk> ; and not only that , but force himself to <unk> all his well known <unk> interest in the general pursuit of his profession .
Be all this as it may , his voice was now often heard hailing the three mast-heads and <unk> them to keep a bright look-out , and not <unk> <unk> even a porpoise .
This vigilance was not long without reward .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
It was a <unk> , <unk> afternoon ; the seamen were lazily lounging about the decks , or <unk> gazing over into the <unk> waters .
Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a <unk> , for an additional lashing to our boat .
So still and <unk> and yet somehow <unk> was all the scene , and such an <unk> of <unk> lurked in the air , that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self .
I was the <unk> or page of Queequeg , while busy at the mat .
As I kept passing and <unk> the filling or woof of <unk> between the long yarns of the warp , using my own hand for the shuttle , and as Queequeg , standing sideways , ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads , and <unk> looking off upon the water , <unk> and <unk> <unk> home every yarn : I say so strange a <unk> did there then <unk> all over the ship and all over the sea , only broken by the <unk> dull sound of the sword , that it seemed as if this were the <unk> of Time , and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates .
There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single , ever returning , <unk> vibration , and that vibration merely enough to admit of the <unk> <unk> of other threads with its own .
This warp seemed necessity ; and here , thought I , with my own hand I <unk> my own shuttle and <unk> my own <unk> into these unalterable threads .
Meantime , Queequeg ’ s <unk> , indifferent sword , sometimes <unk> the woof <unk> , or <unk> , or strongly , or <unk> , as the case might be ; and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed <unk> ; this savage ’ s sword , thought I , which thus finally <unk> and <unk> both warp and woof ; this easy , indifferent sword must be chance — aye , chance , free will , and necessity — <unk> <unk> — all <unk> working together .
The straight warp of necessity , not to be <unk> from its ultimate course — its every <unk> vibration , indeed , only <unk> to that ; free will still free to <unk> her shuttle between given threads ; and chance , though <unk> in its play within the right lines of necessity , and sideways in its motions directed by free will , though thus <unk> to by both , chance by turns rules either , and has the last <unk> blow at events .
Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so strange , long drawn , and <unk> wild and unearthly , that the ball of free will dropped from my hand , and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing .
High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad <unk> , Tashtego .
His body was reaching eagerly forward , his hand stretched out like a <unk> , and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries .
To be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas , from hundreds of whalemen ’ s look-outs perched as high in the air ; but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous <unk> as from Tashtego the Indian ’ s .
As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air , so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon , you would have thought him some prophet or <unk> beholding the shadows of Fate , and by those wild cries announcing their coming .
“ There she blows !
there !
there !
there !
she blows !
she blows ! ” “ <unk> ? ” “ On the <unk> , about two miles off !
a school of them ! ” Instantly all was commotion .
The Sperm Whale blows as a clock <unk> , with the same undeviating and reliable <unk> .
And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other <unk> of his <unk> .
“ There go flukes ! ” was now the cry from Tashtego ; and the whales disappeared .
“ Quick , steward ! ” cried Ahab .
“ Time !
time ! ” Dough-Boy hurried below , glanced at the watch , and reported the exact minute to Ahab .
The ship was now kept away from the wind , and she went gently rolling before it .
Tashtego <unk> that the whales had gone down heading to leeward , we <unk> looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows .
For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when , sounding with his head in one direction , he nevertheless , while <unk> beneath the surface , <unk> round , and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter — this <unk> of his could not now be in action ; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed , or indeed knew at all of our vicinity .
One of the men <unk> for <unk> — that is , those not <unk> to the boats , by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head .
The sailors at the fore and <unk> had come down ; the line tubs were fixed in their places ; the <unk> were thrust out ; the <unk> was backed , and the three boats swung over the sea like three <unk> <unk> over high <unk> .
<unk> of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand <unk> to the rail , while one foot was <unk> <unk> on the gunwale .
So look the long line of <unk> ’ s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy ’ s ship .
But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale .
With a start all <unk> at dark Ahab , who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The First <unk> .
The phantoms , for so they then seemed , were flitting on the other side of the deck , and , with a noiseless <unk> , were casting loose the tackles and <unk> of the boat which swung there .
This boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats , though technically called the captain ’ s , on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter .
The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart , with one white tooth <unk> <unk> from its <unk> lips .
A <unk> Chinese jacket of black <unk> <unk> invested him , with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff .
But strangely <unk> this <unk> was a glistening white <unk> <unk> , the living hair <unk> and coiled round and round upon his head .
<unk> swart in aspect , the companions of this figure were of that vivid , <unk> complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal <unk> of the <unk> ; — a race <unk> for a certain <unk> of <unk> , and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid <unk> and secret confidential <unk> on the water of the devil , their lord , whose <unk> they suppose to be elsewhere .
While yet the wondering ship ’ s company were gazing upon these strangers , Ahab cried out to the <unk> old man at their head , “ All ready there , Fedallah ? ” “ <unk> , ” was the <unk> reply .
“ Lower away then ; d ’ ye hear ? ” shouting across the deck .
“ Lower away there , I say . ” Such was the thunder of his voice , that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail ; the <unk> <unk> round in the blocks ; with a <unk> , the three boats dropped into the sea ; while , with a dexterous , <unk> daring , unknown in any other vocation , the sailors , <unk> , leaped down the rolling ship ’ s side into the tossed boats below .
<unk> had they pulled out from under the ship ’ s lee , when a fourth keel , coming from the windward side , pulled round under the stern , and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab , who , standing erect in the stern , loudly hailed Starbuck , Stubb , and Flask , to spread themselves widely , so as to cover a large <unk> of water .
But with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew , the <unk> of the other boats <unk> not the command .
“ Captain Ahab ? — ” said Starbuck .
“ <unk> yourselves , ” cried Ahab ; “ give way , all four boats .
Thou , Flask , pull out more to leeward ! ” “ Aye , aye , sir , ” cheerily cried little King-Post , sweeping round his great steering oar .
“ Lay back ! ” <unk> his crew .
“ There ! — there ! — there again !
There she blows right ahead , boys ! — lay back ! ” “ Never heed yonder yellow boys , Archy . ” “ Oh , I don ’ t mind ’ em , sir , ” said Archy ; “ I knew it all before now .
Didn ’ t I hear ’ em in the hold ?
And didn ’ t I tell Cabaco here of it ?
What say ye , Cabaco ?
They are <unk> , Mr. Flask . ” “ Pull , pull , my fine <unk> ; pull , my children ; pull , my little ones , ” <unk> and <unk> <unk> Stubb to his crew , some of whom still showed signs of <unk> .
“ Why don ’ t you break your <unk> , my boys ?
What is it you <unk> at ?
Those chaps in yonder boat ?
<unk> !
They are only five more hands come to help us — never mind from where — the more the <unk> .
Pull , then , do pull ; never mind the <unk> — devils are good fellows enough .
So , so ; there you are now ; that ’ s the stroke for a thousand <unk> ; that ’ s the stroke to sweep the <unk> !
Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil , my heroes !
Three cheers , men — all hearts alive !
<unk> , easy ; don ’ t be in a hurry — don ’ t be in a hurry .
Why don ’ t you snap your oars , you <unk> ?
<unk> something , you dogs !
So , so , so , then : — softly , softly !
That ’ s it — that ’ s it !
long and strong .
Give way there , give way !
The devil fetch ye , ye <unk> <unk> ; ye are all asleep .
Stop <unk> , ye sleepers , and pull .
Pull , will ye ?
pull , can ’ t ye ?
pull , won ’ t ye ?
Why in the name of <unk> and <unk> don ’ t ye pull ? — pull and break something !
pull , and start your eyes out !
Here ! ” <unk> out the sharp knife from his <unk> ; “ every mother ’ s son of ye draw his knife , and pull with the blade between his teeth .
That ’ s it — that ’ s it .
Now ye do something ; that looks like it , my <unk> .
Start her — start her , my <unk> !
Start her , <unk> ! ” Stubb ’ s <unk> to his crew is given here at large , because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general , and especially in <unk> the religion of rowing .
But you must not suppose from this specimen of his <unk> that he ever flew into downright <unk> with his congregation .
Not at all ; and therein <unk> his chief peculiarity .
He would say the most terrific things to his crew , in a tone so strangely <unk> of fun and fury , and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a <unk> to the fun , that no oarsman could hear such queer <unk> without pulling for dear life , and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing .
Besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself , so <unk> <unk> his <unk> , and so <unk> <unk> — <unk> at times — that the mere sight of such a <unk> commander , by <unk> force of contrast , <unk> like a charm upon the crew .
Then again , Stubb was one of those odd sort of <unk> , whose <unk> is sometimes so curiously <unk> , as to put all <unk> on their guard in the matter of obeying them .
In obedience to a sign from Ahab , Starbuck was now pulling obliquely across Stubb ’ s bow ; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other , Stubb hailed the mate .
“ Mr.
Starbuck !
larboard boat there , ahoy !
a word with ye , sir , if ye please ! ” “ Halloa ! ” returned Starbuck , turning round not a single inch as he spoke ; still earnestly but <unk> <unk> his crew ; his face set like a <unk> from Stubb ’ s .
“ What think ye of those yellow boys , sir ! ” “ <unk> on board , somehow , before the ship sailed .
( <unk> , strong , boys !
) ” in a <unk> to his crew , then speaking out loud again : “ A sad business , Mr. Stubb !
( <unk> her , <unk> her , my lads ! )
but never mind , Mr. Stubb , all for the best .
Let all your crew pull strong , come what will .
( Spring , my men , spring ! )
There ’ s <unk> of sperm ahead , Mr. Stubb , and that ’ s what ye came for .
( Pull , my boys ! )
Sperm , sperm ’ s the play !
This at least is duty ; duty and profit hand in hand . ” “ Aye , aye , I thought as much , ” soliloquized Stubb , when the boats <unk> , “ as soon as I <unk> eye on ’ em , I thought so .
Aye , and that ’ s what he went into the after hold for , so often , as Dough-Boy long suspected .
They were hidden down there .
The White Whale ’ s at the bottom of it .
Well , well , so be it !
Can ’ t be helped !
All right !
Give way , men !
It ain ’ t the White Whale to-day !
Give way ! ” Now the <unk> of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck , this had not <unk> awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship ’ s company ; but Archy ’ s fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them , though indeed not <unk> then , this had in some small measure prepared them for the event .
It took off the extreme edge of their wonder ; and so what with all this and Stubb ’ s <unk> way of <unk> for their appearance , they were for the time <unk> from superstitious <unk> ; though the affair still left <unk> room for all manner of wild <unk> as to dark Ahab ’ s precise <unk> in the matter from the beginning .
For me , I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen <unk> on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn , as well as the <unk> <unk> of the unaccountable Elijah .
Meantime , Ahab , out of hearing of his officers , having <unk> the furthest to windward , was still ranging ahead of the other boats ; a circumstance <unk> how potent a crew was pulling him .
Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone ; like five <unk> they rose and fell with regular <unk> of strength , which <unk> started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst <unk> out of a <unk> <unk> .
As for Fedallah , who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar , he had thrown aside his black jacket , and <unk> his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale , <unk> cut against the <unk> <unk> of the watery horizon ; while at the other end of the boat Ahab , with one arm , like a <unk> ’ s , thrown half backward into the air , as if to <unk> any <unk> to <unk> ; Ahab was seen steadily <unk> his steering oar as in a thousand boat <unk> ere the White Whale had torn him .
All at once the <unk> arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed , while the boat ’ s five oars were seen simultaneously <unk> .
Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea .
Instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way .
The whales had <unk> settled bodily down into the blue , thus giving no <unk> discernible token of the movement , though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it .
“ Every man look out along his oars ! ” cried Starbuck .
“ Thou , Queequeg , stand up ! ” <unk> springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow , the savage stood erect there , and with <unk> eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been descried .
Likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also <unk> <unk> level with the gunwale , Starbuck himself was seen coolly and <unk> <unk> himself to the jerking <unk> of his chip of a craft , and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea .
Not very far distant Flask ’ s boat was also lying <unk> still ; its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead , a stout sort of post rooted in the keel , and rising some two feet above the level of the stern <unk> .
It is used for catching turns with the whale line .
<unk> top is not more <unk> than the palm of a man ’ s hand , and standing upon such a base as that , Flask seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her <unk> .
But little King-Post was small and short , and at the same time little King-Post was full of a large and tall <unk> , so that this loggerhead <unk> of his did by no means <unk> King-Post .
“ I can ’ t see three seas off ; <unk> us up an oar there , and let me on to that . ” Upon this , Daggoo , with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way , swiftly slid aft , and then <unk> himself <unk> his lofty shoulders for a <unk> .
“ Good a mast-head as any , sir .
Will you mount ? ” “ That I will , and thank ye very much , my fine fellow ; only I wish you fifty feet <unk> . ” <unk> planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat , the gigantic negro , stooping a little , presented his flat palm to Flask ’ s foot , and then putting Flask ’ s hand on his <unk> head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss , with one dexterous <unk> landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders .
And here was Flask now standing , Daggoo with one lifted arm <unk> him with a <unk> to lean against and steady himself by .
At any time it is a strange sight to the <unk> to see with what wondrous <unk> of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat , even when pitched about by the most <unk> <unk> and <unk> seas .
Still more strange to see him <unk> perched upon the loggerhead itself , under such circumstances .
But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious ; for <unk> himself with a cool , indifferent , easy , <unk> of , barbaric majesty , the noble negro to every roll of the sea <unk> rolled his fine form .
On his broad back , <unk> Flask seemed a <unk> .
The <unk> looked <unk> than the <unk> .
Though truly <unk> , tumultuous , <unk> little Flask would now and then <unk> with impatience ; but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro ’ s <unk> chest .
So have I seen <unk> and <unk> <unk> the living <unk> earth , but the earth did not <unk> her tides and her seasons for that .
Meanwhile Stubb , the third mate , betrayed no such <unk> <unk> .
The whales might have made one of their regular soundings , not a temporary dive from mere fright ; and if that were the case , Stubb , as his wont in such cases , it seems , was resolved to <unk> the <unk> interval with his pipe .
He <unk> it from his <unk> , where he always wore it <unk> like a <unk> .
He loaded it , and <unk> home the <unk> with his <unk> ; but hardly had he <unk> his match across the rough <unk> of his hand , when Tashtego , his harpooneer , whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars , suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat , <unk> out in a quick <unk> of hurry , “ Down , down all , and give way ! — there they are ! ” To a landsman , no whale , nor any sign of a herring , would have been visible at that moment ; nothing but a troubled bit of <unk> white water , and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it , and <unk> blowing off to leeward , like the <unk> scud from white rolling billows .
The air around suddenly <unk> and <unk> , as it were , like the air over <unk> <unk> plates of iron .
<unk> this <unk> waving and curling , and <unk> beneath a thin layer of water , also , the whales were swimming .
<unk> in advance of all the other <unk> , the puffs of vapor they spouted , seemed their <unk> <unk> and detached flying <unk> .
All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air .
But it bade fair to <unk> them ; it flew on and on , as a mass of <unk> bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills .
“ Pull , pull , my good boys , ” said Starbuck , in the <unk> possible but <unk> <unk> <unk> to his men ; while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow , almost seemed as two visible needles in two <unk> binnacle compasses .
He did not say much to his crew , though , nor did his crew say anything to him .
Only the silence of the boat was at intervals <unk> <unk> by one of his peculiar <unk> , now <unk> with command , now soft with <unk> .
How different the loud little King-Post .
“ Sing out and say something , my <unk> .
<unk> and pull , my <unk> !
<unk> me , beach me on their black backs , boys ; only do that for me , and I ’ ll sign over to you my Martha ’ s Vineyard <unk> , boys ; including wife and children , boys .
Lay me on — lay me on !
O Lord , Lord !
but I shall go stark , staring mad !
See !
see that white water ! ” And so shouting , he pulled his hat from his head , and <unk> up and down on it ; then picking it up , <unk> it far off upon the sea ; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat ’ s stern like a <unk> colt from the prairie .
“ Look at that chap now , ” <unk> <unk> Stubb , who , with his <unk> short pipe , mechanically retained between his teeth , at a short distance , followed after — “ He ’ s got fits , that Flask has .
<unk> ?
yes , give him fits — that ’ s the very word — pitch fits into ’ em .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> for supper , you know ; — merry ’ s the word .
Pull , <unk> — pull , <unk> — pull , all .
But what the devil are you hurrying about ?
<unk> , softly , and steadily , my men .
Only pull , and keep pulling ; nothing more .
<unk> all your <unk> , and <unk> your knives in two — that ’ s all .
Take it easy — why don ’ t ye take it easy , I say , and burst all your <unk> and lungs ! ” But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that <unk> crew of his — these were words best omitted here ; for you live under the blessed light of the <unk> land .
Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words , when , with <unk> brow , and eyes of red murder , and <unk> lips , Ahab leaped after his prey .
Meanwhile , all the boats tore on .
The repeated specific allusions of Flask to “ that whale , ” as he called the <unk> monster which he declared to be <unk> <unk> his boat ’ s bow with its tail — these allusions of his were at times so vivid and <unk> , that they would cause some one or two of his men to <unk> a fearful look over the shoulder .
But this was against all rule ; for the oarsmen must put out their eyes , and <unk> a <unk> through their <unk> ; usage <unk> that they must have no <unk> but ears , and no limbs but arms , in these critical moments .
It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe !
The vast swells of the omnipotent sea ; the <unk> , hollow roar they made , as they rolled along the eight gunwales , like gigantic <unk> in a boundless <unk> ; the brief suspended agony of the boat , as it would <unk> for an instant on the <unk> edge of the <unk> waves , that almost seemed <unk> to cut it in two ; the sudden profound dip into the watery <unk> and <unk> ; the keen <unk> and <unk> to gain the top of the opposite hill ; the headlong , <unk> slide down its other side ; — all these , with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers , and the shuddering <unk> of the oarsmen , with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with <unk> sails , like a wild <unk> after her screaming <unk> ; — all this was <unk> .
Not the <unk> <unk> , marching from the bosom of his wife into the <unk> heat of his first battle ; not the dead man ’ s ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world ; — neither of these can feel stranger and <unk> emotions than that man does , who for the first time finds himself pulling into the <unk> , <unk> circle of the hunted sperm whale .
The dancing white water made by the chase was now <unk> more and more visible , owing to the increasing darkness of the <unk> <unk> flung upon the sea .
The jets of vapor no longer blended , but <unk> everywhere to right and left ; the whales seemed <unk> their wakes .
The boats were pulled more apart ; Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward .
Our sail was now set , and , with the still rising wind , we rushed along ; the boat going with such madness through the water , that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the <unk> .
Soon we were running through a <unk> wide veil of mist ; neither ship nor boat to be seen .
“ Give way , men , ” whispered Starbuck , drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail ; “ there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes .
There ’ s white water again ! — close to !
Spring ! ” Soon after , two cries in quick succession on each side of us <unk> that the other boats had got fast ; but hardly were they <unk> , when with a <unk> <unk> <unk> Starbuck said : “ Stand up ! ” and Queequeg , harpoon in hand , sprang to his feet .
Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead , yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat , they knew that the imminent instant had come ; they heard , too , an enormous <unk> sound as of fifty elephants <unk> in their <unk> .
Meanwhile the boat was still <unk> through the mist , the waves curling and <unk> around us like the erected <unk> of enraged <unk> .
“ That ’ s his hump .
_ There _ , _ there _ , give it to him ! ” whispered Starbuck .
A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat ; it was the darted iron of Queequeg .
Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern , while forward the boat seemed striking on a <unk> ; the sail <unk> and <unk> ; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by ; something rolled and tumbled like an <unk> beneath us .
The whole crew were half <unk> as they were tossed <unk> into the white <unk> <unk> of the squall .
<unk> , whale , and harpoon had all blended together ; and the whale , merely <unk> by the iron , escaped .
Though completely <unk> , the boat was nearly unharmed .
<unk> round it we picked up the floating oars , and lashing them across the gunwale , tumbled back to our places .
There we sat up to our knees in the sea , the water covering every rib and plank , so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean .
The wind increased to a <unk> ; the waves dashed their <unk> together ; the whole squall roared , forked , and <unk> around us like a white fire upon the prairie , in which , <unk> , we were burning ; immortal in these jaws of death !
In vain we hailed the other boats ; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming <unk> as hail those boats in that storm .
Meanwhile the driving scud , rack , and mist , grew darker with the shadows of night ; no sign of the ship could be seen .
The rising sea forbade all attempts to <unk> out the boat .
The oars were useless as <unk> , performing now the office of <unk> .
So , cutting the lashing of the <unk> match <unk> , after many <unk> Starbuck <unk> to <unk> the lamp in the lantern ; then stretching it on a waif pole , <unk> it to Queequeg as the <unk> of this <unk> hope .
There , then , he sat , holding up that <unk> candle in the heart of that <unk> <unk> .
There , then , he sat , the sign and symbol of a man without faith , hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair .
<unk> , <unk> through , and shivering cold , <unk> of ship or boat , we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on .
The mist still spread over the sea , the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat .
Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet , <unk> his hand to his ear .
We all heard a faint <unk> , as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm .
The sound came nearer and nearer ; the thick <unk> were dimly parted by a huge , vague form .
<unk> , we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view , bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length .
<unk> on the waves we saw the abandoned boat , as for one instant it tossed and <unk> beneath the ship ’ s bows like a chip at the base of a <unk> ; and then the vast hull rolled over it , and it was seen no more till it came up <unk> astern .
Again we swam for it , were dashed against it by the seas , and were at last taken up and safely landed on board .
Ere the squall came close to , the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time .
The ship had given us up , but was still cruising , if <unk> it might light upon some token of our <unk> , — an oar or a lance pole .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Hyena .
There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke , though the <unk> <unk> he but dimly <unk> , and more than <unk> that the joke is at <unk> ’ s expense but his own .
However , nothing <unk> , and nothing seems worth while <unk> .
He bolts down all events , all <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , all hard things visible and invisible , never mind how <unk> ; as an <unk> of potent <unk> <unk> down <unk> and gun <unk> .
And as for small <unk> and <unk> , <unk> of sudden <unk> , peril of life and limb ; all these , and death itself , seem to him only <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and jolly <unk> in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old <unk> .
That odd sort of <unk> mood I am speaking of , comes over a man only in some time of extreme <unk> ; it comes in the very midst of his <unk> , so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous , now seems but a part of the general joke .
There is nothing like the perils of whaling to <unk> this free and easy sort of genial , <unk> philosophy ; and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod , and the great White Whale its object .
“ Queequeg , ” said I , when they had dragged me , the last man , to the deck , and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to <unk> off the water ; “ Queequeg , my fine friend , does this sort of thing often happen ? ” <unk> much emotion , though <unk> through just like me , he gave me to understand that such things did often happen .
“ Mr.
Stubb , ” said I , turning to that worthy , who , <unk> up in his <unk> , was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain ; “ Mr.
Stubb , I think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met , our chief mate , Mr. Starbuck , is by far the most careful and prudent .
I suppose then , that going <unk> on a flying whale with your sail set in a <unk> squall is the height of a whaleman ’ s <unk> ? ” “ <unk> .
I ’ ve lowered for whales from a <unk> ship in a gale off Cape Horn . ” “ Mr.
Flask , ” said I , turning to little King-Post , who was standing close by ; “ you are experienced in these things , and I am not .
Will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery , Mr. Flask , for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself <unk> into death ’ s jaws ? ” “ Can ’ t you <unk> that smaller ? ” said Flask .
“ Yes , that ’ s the law .
I should like to see a boat ’ s crew backing water up to a whale face foremost .
Ha , ha !
the whale would give them <unk> for <unk> , mind that ! ” Here then , from three <unk> <unk> , I had a deliberate <unk> of the entire case .
<unk> , therefore , that squalls and <unk> in the water and <unk> <unk> on the deep , were matters of common <unk> in this kind of life ; considering that at the <unk> critical instant of going on to the whale I must <unk> my life into the hands of him who steered the boat — oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his <unk> upon the point of <unk> the craft with his own frantic <unk> ; considering that the particular <unk> to our own particular boat was chiefly to be <unk> to Starbuck ’ s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall , and considering that Starbuck , notwithstanding , was famous for his great <unk> in the fishery ; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent Starbuck ’ s boat ; and finally considering in what a devil ’ s chase I was <unk> , touching the White Whale : taking all things together , I say , I thought I might as well go below and make a rough <unk> of my will .
“ Queequeg , ” said I , “ come along , you shall be my <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . ” It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be <unk> at their last <unk> and <unk> , but there are no people in the world more fond of that <unk> .
This was the fourth time in my <unk> life that I had done the same thing .
After the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion , I felt all the <unk> ; a stone was rolled away from my heart .
Besides , all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection ; a <unk> clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be .
I <unk> myself ; my death and <unk> were locked up in my chest .
I looked round me tranquilly and <unk> , like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the <unk> of a snug family <unk> .
Now then , thought I , unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my <unk> , here goes for a cool , collected dive at death and destruction , and the devil fetch the <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> .
Ahab ’ s Boat and <unk> .
Fedallah .
“ Who would have thought it , Flask ! ” cried Stubb ; “ if I had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat , unless <unk> to stop the <unk> with my timber <unk> .
Oh !
he ’ s a wonderful old man ! ” “ I don ’ t think it so strange , after all , on that account , ” said Flask .
“ If his leg were off at the <unk> , now , it would be a different thing .
That would <unk> him ; but he has one knee , and good part of the other left , you know . ” “ I don ’ t know that , my little man ; I never yet saw him <unk> . ” Among <unk> people it has often been argued whether , considering the <unk> importance of his life to the success of the voyage , it is right for a whaling captain to <unk> that life in the active perils of the chase .
So <unk> ’ s <unk> often argued with tears in their eyes , whether that <unk> life of his ought to be carried into the <unk> of the fight .
But with Ahab the question <unk> a modified aspect .
<unk> that with two legs man is but a <unk> wight in all times of danger ; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary <unk> ; that every individual moment , indeed , then <unk> a peril ; under these circumstances is it wise for any <unk> man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt ?
As a general thing , the <unk> of the Pequod must have plainly thought not .
Ahab well knew that <unk> his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase , for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person , yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually <unk> to him as a regular headsman in the hunt — above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men , as that same boat ’ s crew , he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the Pequod .
Therefore he had not <unk> a boat ’ s crew from them , nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head .
Nevertheless he had taken private <unk> of his own touching all that matter .
<unk> Cabaco ’ s published discovery , the sailors had little <unk> it , though to be sure when , after being a little while out of port , all hands had concluded the customary business of <unk> the <unk> for service ; when some time after this Ahab was now and then found <unk> himself in the matter of making <unk> with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats , and even <unk> cutting the small wooden <unk> , which when the line is running out are <unk> over the <unk> in the bow : when all this was observed in him , and particularly his <unk> in having an extra coat of <unk> in the bottom of the boat , as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb ; and also the <unk> he evinced in exactly <unk> the thigh board , or clumsy <unk> , as it is sometimes called , the horizontal piece in the boat ’ s bow for bracing the knee against in darting or <unk> at the whale ; when it was observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and with the carpenter ’ s <unk> <unk> out a little here and straightened it a little there ; all these things , I say , had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time .
But almost everybody supposed that this particular <unk> <unk> in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick ; for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person .
But such a <unk> did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat ’ s crew being <unk> to that boat .
Now , with the <unk> phantoms , what wonder remained soon <unk> away ; for in a whaler wonders soon <unk> .
Besides , now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown <unk> and <unk> of the earth to man these floating <unk> of whalers ; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer <unk> creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks , bits of wreck , oars , <unk> , canoes , <unk> Japanese <unk> , and what not ; that <unk> himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain , and it would not <unk> any <unk> excitement in the forecastle .
But be all this as it may , certain it is that while the <unk> phantoms soon found their place among the crew , though still as it were somehow distinct from them , yet that <unk> Fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last .
<unk> he came in a <unk> world like this , by what sort of unaccountable <unk> he soon evinced himself to be linked with Ahab ’ s peculiar <unk> ; nay , so far as to have some sort of a <unk> influence ; Heaven knows , but it might have been even authority over him ; all this none knew .
But one cannot <unk> an indifferent air concerning Fedallah .
He was such a creature as civilized , domestic people in the <unk> zone only see in their dreams , and that but dimly ; but the like of whom now and then <unk> among the <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent — those <unk> , immemorial , unalterable countries , which even in these modern days still preserve much of the <unk> <unk> of earth ’ s primal generations , when the memory of the first man was a distinct <unk> , and all men his <unk> , <unk> whence he came , eyed each other as real phantoms , and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end ; when though , according to <unk> , the angels indeed <unk> with the daughters of men , the devils also , add the <unk> <unk> , <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
<unk> , weeks passed , and under easy sail , the ivory Pequod had slowly swept across four several <unk> ; that off the <unk> ; off the Cape de <unk> ; on the <unk> ( so called ) , being off the mouth of the <unk> de la <unk> ; and the <unk> Ground , an <unk> , watery <unk> , <unk> from St. <unk> .
It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night , when all the waves rolled by like <unk> of silver ; and , by their soft , <unk> <unk> , made what seemed a silvery silence , not a <unk> ; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow .
<unk> up by the moon , it looked celestial ; seemed some <unk> and glittering god uprising from the sea .
Fedallah first descried this jet .
For of these moonlight nights , it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head , and stand a look-out there , with the same <unk> as if it had been day .
And yet , though herds of whales were seen by night , not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them .
You may think with what emotions , then , the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours ; his <unk> and the moon , companions in one sky .
But when , after spending his <unk> interval there for several successive nights without <unk> a single sound ; when , after all this silence , his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery , <unk> jet , every <unk> mariner started to his feet as if some <unk> spirit had lighted in the rigging , and hailed the mortal crew .
“ There she blows ! ” Had the <unk> of judgment blown , they could not have <unk> more ; yet still they felt no terror ; rather <unk> .
For though it was a most unwonted hour , yet so <unk> was the cry , and so <unk> <unk> , that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering .
<unk> the deck with quick , <unk> <unk> , Ahab commanded the t ’ gallant sails and <unk> to be set , and every <unk> spread .
The best man in the ship must take the helm .
Then , with every mast-head manned , the <unk> craft rolled down before the wind .
The strange , <unk> , lifting <unk> of the taffrail breeze filling the <unk> of so many sails , made the buoyant , hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet ; while still she rushed along , as if two <unk> influences were struggling in her — one to mount direct to heaven , the other to drive <unk> to some horizontal <unk> .
And had you watched Ahab ’ s face that night , you would have thought that in him also two different things were <unk> .
While his one live leg made lively <unk> along the deck , every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a <unk> .
On life and death this old man walked .
But though the ship so swiftly <unk> , and though from every eye , like <unk> , the eager glances shot , yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night .
Every sailor swore he saw it once , but not a second time .
This <unk> had almost grown a forgotten thing , when , some days after , lo !
at the same silent hour , it was again announced : again it was descried by all ; but upon making sail to <unk> it , once more it disappeared as if it had never been .
And so it served us night after night , till no one heeded it but to wonder at it .
<unk> <unk> into the clear moonlight , or <unk> , as the case might be ; <unk> again for one whole day , or two days , or three ; and somehow seeming at every distinct <unk> to be advancing still further and further in our <unk> , this solitary jet seemed for ever <unk> us on .
Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race , and in accordance with the <unk> , as it seemed , which in many things invested the Pequod , were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried ; at however remote times , or in however far apart latitudes and <unk> , that <unk> spout was cast by one <unk> whale ; and that whale , Moby Dick .
For a time , there reigned , too , a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition , as if it were <unk> <unk> us on and on , in order that the monster might turn round upon us , and <unk> us at last in the remotest and most savage seas .
These temporary <unk> , so vague but so awful , derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather , in which , beneath all its blue <unk> , some thought there lurked a devilish charm , as for days and days we <unk> along , through seas so <unk> , <unk> mild , that all space , in <unk> to our vengeful errand , seemed <unk> itself of life before our <unk> prow .
But , at last , when turning to the eastward , the Cape winds began howling around us , and we rose and fell upon the long , troubled seas that are there ; when the <unk> Pequod <unk> bowed to the blast , and <unk> the dark waves in her madness , till , like <unk> of silver chips , the <unk> flew over her bulwarks ; then all this <unk> <unk> of life went away , but gave place to sights more dismal than before .
<unk> to our bows , strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us ; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable <unk> .
And every morning , perched on our <unk> , rows of these birds were seen ; and spite of our <unk> , for a long time <unk> <unk> to the hemp , as though they deemed our ship some <unk> , <unk> craft ; a thing <unk> to <unk> , and therefore fit <unk> for their <unk> <unk> .
And heaved and heaved , still <unk> heaved the black sea , as if its vast tides were a conscience ; and the great <unk> soul were in anguish and <unk> for the long sin and suffering it had bred .
Cape of Good Hope , do they call ye ?
Rather Cape <unk> , as called of <unk> ; for long <unk> by the <unk> <unk> that before had attended us , we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea , where guilty beings <unk> into those fowls and these fish , seemed condemned to swim on <unk> without any haven in store , or beat that black air without any horizon .
But calm , snow-white , and <unk> ; still <unk> its fountain of <unk> to the sky ; still <unk> us on from before , the solitary jet would at times be descried .
During all this blackness of the elements , Ahab , though <unk> for the time the almost continual command of the <unk> and dangerous deck , <unk> the <unk> <unk> ; and more seldom than ever addressed his mates .
In tempestuous times like these , after everything above and aloft has been secured , nothing more can be done but <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the gale .
Then Captain and crew become practical <unk> .
So , with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole , and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud , Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward , while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but <unk> his very <unk> together .
Meantime , the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that <unk> broke over its bows , stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist ; and the better to guard against the leaping waves , each man had slipped himself into a sort of <unk> secured to the rail , in which he swung as in a <unk> belt .
<unk> or no words were spoken ; and the silent ship , as if manned by painted sailors in <unk> , day after day tore on through all the swift madness and <unk> of the <unk> waves .
By night the same <unk> of <unk> before the shrieks of the ocean <unk> ; still in silence the men swung in the <unk> ; still <unk> Ahab stood up to the blast .
Even when <unk> nature seemed <unk> repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock .
Never could Starbuck forget the old man ’ s aspect , when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the <unk> stood , he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his <unk> chair ; the rain and <unk> sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged , still slowly dripping from the <unk> hat and coat .
On the table beside him lay <unk> one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of .
His lantern swung from his <unk> clenched hand .
Though the body was erect , the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the <unk> that swung from a <unk> in the ceiling .
* * The <unk> is called the <unk> , because without going to the compass at the helm , the Captain , while below , can <unk> himself of the course of the ship .
<unk> old man !
thought Starbuck with a shudder , sleeping in this gale , still thou steadfastly <unk> thy purpose .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Albatross .
<unk> from the Cape , off the distant <unk> , a good cruising ground for Right <unk> , a sail loomed ahead , the <unk> ( Albatross ) by name .
As she slowly drew nigh , from my lofty perch at the <unk> , I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a <unk> in the far ocean <unk> — a whaler at sea , and long absent from home .
As if the waves had been <unk> , this craft was <unk> like the skeleton of a stranded walrus .
All down her sides , this <unk> appearance was <unk> with long <unk> of <unk> rust , while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees <unk> over with <unk> .
Only her lower sails were set .
A wild sight it was to see her <unk> look-outs at those three mast-heads .
They seemed <unk> in the <unk> of beasts , so torn and <unk> the <unk> that had <unk> nearly four years of cruising .
Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast , they swayed and swung over a <unk> sea ; and though , when the ship slowly glided close under our stern , we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one ship to those of the other ; yet , those <unk> fishermen , mildly eyeing us as they passed , said not one word to our own look-outs , while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below .
“ Ship ahoy !
Have ye seen the White Whale ? ” But as the strange captain , leaning over the <unk> bulwarks , was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth , it somehow fell from his hand into the sea ; and the wind now rising <unk> , he in vain strove to make himself heard without it .
Meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between .
While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were <unk> their <unk> of this <unk> incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale ’ s name to another ship , Ahab for a moment paused ; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger , had not the <unk> wind forbade .
But taking advantage of his windward position , he again seized his trumpet , and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home , he loudly hailed — “ <unk> there !
This is the Pequod , bound round the world !
Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean !
and this time three years , if I am not at home , tell them to address them to — — ” At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed , and instantly , then , in accordance with their singular ways , shoals of small harmless fish , that for some days before had been <unk> swimming by our side , darted away with what seemed shuddering fins , and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger ’ s flanks .
Though in the course of his continual <unk> Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight , yet , to any monomaniac man , the <unk> <unk> <unk> carry meanings .
“ <unk> away from me , do ye ? ” murmured Ahab , gazing over into the water .
There seemed but little in the words , but the tone conveyed more of deep <unk> <unk> than the <unk> old man had ever before evinced .
But turning to the steersman , who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to <unk> her headway , he cried out in his old <unk> voice , — “ Up helm !
<unk> her off round the world ! ” Round the world !
There is much in that sound to <unk> proud feelings ; but <unk> does all that <unk> conduct ?
Only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started , where those that we left behind secure , were all the time before us .
Were this world an endless plain , and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new <unk> , and discover sights more sweet and strange than any <unk> or Islands of King Solomon , then there were promise in the voyage .
But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of , or in tormented chase of that <unk> phantom that , some time or other , swims before all human hearts ; while chasing such over this round globe , they either lead us on in <unk> <unk> or midway leave us <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Gam .
The <unk> reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this : the wind and sea betokened storms .
But even had this not been the case , he would not after all , perhaps , have boarded her — <unk> by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions — if so it had been that , by the process of hailing , he had obtained a <unk> answer to the question he put .
For , as it eventually turned out , he <unk> not to <unk> , even for five minutes , with any stranger captain , except he could <unk> some of that information he so <unk> sought .
But all this might remain <unk> <unk> , were not something said here of the peculiar <unk> of <unk> when meeting each other in foreign seas , and especially on a common cruising-ground .
If two strangers crossing the <unk> <unk> in New York State , or the equally <unk> <unk> <unk> in England ; if <unk> encountering each other in such <unk> <unk> , these twain , for the life of them , cannot well avoid a mutual <unk> ; and stopping for a moment to <unk> the news ; and , perhaps , sitting down for a while and resting in <unk> : then , how much more natural that upon the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the sea , two whaling vessels <unk> each other at the ends of the earth — off lone <unk> ’ s Island , or the far away King ’ s <unk> ; how much more natural , I say , that under such circumstances these ships should not only <unk> <unk> , but come into still closer , more friendly and sociable contact .
And especially would this seem to be a matter of course , in the case of vessels owned in one <unk> , and whose captains , officers , and not a few of the men are personally known to each other ; and <unk> , have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about .
For the long absent ship , the <unk> , perhaps , has letters on board ; at any rate , she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two <unk> than the last one on her <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And in return for that courtesy , the <unk> ship would receive the <unk> whaling intelligence from the cruising-ground to which she may be destined , a thing of the utmost importance to her .
And in degree , all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other ’ s track on the cruising-ground itself , even though they are equally long absent from home .
For one of them may have received a <unk> of letters from some third , and now far remote vessel ; and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now <unk> .
Besides , they would <unk> the whaling news , and have an <unk> chat .
For not only would they meet with all the <unk> of sailors , but likewise with all the peculiar <unk> <unk> from a common pursuit and <unk> <unk> <unk> and perils .
Nor would difference of country make any very <unk> difference ; that is , so long as both parties speak one language , as is the case with Americans and English .
Though , to be sure , from the small number of English whalers , such <unk> do not very often occur , and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of <unk> between them ; for your Englishman is rather reserved , and your <unk> , he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself .
Besides , the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of <unk> superiority over the American whalers ; regarding the long , lean Nantucketer , with his <unk> <unk> , as a sort of <unk> .
But where this superiority in the English whalemen does really <unk> , it would be hard to say , seeing that the <unk> in one day , <unk> , kill more whales than all the English , <unk> , in ten years .
But this is a harmless little <unk> in the English <unk> , which the Nantucketer does not take much to heart ; probably , because he knows that he has a few <unk> himself .
So , then , we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea , the whalers have most reason to be sociable — and they are so .
Whereas , some merchant ships crossing each other ’ s wake in the <unk> , will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of <unk> , <unk> cutting each other on the high seas , like a brace of <unk> in <unk> ; and all the time <unk> , perhaps , in <unk> <unk> upon each other ’ s rig .
As for <unk> , when they chance to meet at sea , they first go through such a string of silly <unk> and <unk> , such a <unk> of <unk> , that there does not seem to be much <unk> hearty <unk> and <unk> love about it at all .
As touching <unk> meeting , why , they are in such a prodigious hurry , they run away from each other as soon as possible .
And as for <unk> , when they chance to cross each other ’ s <unk> , the first hail is — “ How many skulls ? ” — the same way that whalers hail — “ How many barrels ? ” And that question once answered , pirates straightway steer apart , for they are infernal <unk> on both sides , and don ’ t like to see <unk> of each other ’ s <unk> <unk> .
But look at the <unk> , honest , <unk> , hospitable , sociable , <unk> whaler !
What does the whaler do when she <unk> another whaler in any sort of decent weather ?
She has a “ _ Gam _ , ” a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even ; and if by chance they should hear of it , they only grin at it , and <unk> gamesome stuff about “ <unk> ” and “ <unk> , ” and such like pretty <unk> .
Why it is that all <unk> , and also all <unk> and <unk> ’ s men , and <unk> sailors , cherish such a <unk> feeling towards <unk> ; this is a question it would be hard to answer .
Because , in the case of pirates , say , I should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it .
It sometimes ends in uncommon <unk> , indeed ; but only at the gallows .
And besides , when a man is elevated in that odd fashion , he has no proper <unk> for his superior <unk> .
Hence , I conclude , that in <unk> himself to be high lifted above a whaleman , in that <unk> the pirate has no solid <unk> to stand on .
But what is a _ Gam ? _ You might wear out your <unk> running up and down the <unk> of <unk> , and never find the word .
Dr. Johnson never <unk> to that <unk> ; Noah Webster ’ s ark does not hold it .
Nevertheless , this same <unk> word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born <unk> .
<unk> , it needs a definition , and should be <unk> into the <unk> .
With that view , let me <unk> <unk> it .
<unk> .
<unk> — _ A social meeting of two _ ( _ or more _ ) _ <unk> , generally on a cruising-ground ; when , after <unk> <unk> , they <unk> visits by boats ’ crews : the two captains remaining , for the time , on board of one ship , and the two chief mates on the other . _ There is another little <unk> about <unk> which must not be forgotten here .
All <unk> have their own little peculiarities of detail ; so has the whale fishery .
In a pirate , <unk> , or slave ship , when the captain is <unk> anywhere in his boat , he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable , sometimes <unk> seat there , and often <unk> himself with a pretty little <unk> ’ s tiller <unk> with gay cords and <unk> .
But the whale-boat has no seat astern , no <unk> of that sort whatever , and no tiller at all .
High times indeed , if whaling captains were <unk> about the water on <unk> like <unk> old <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
And as for a tiller , the whale-boat never <unk> of any such <unk> ; and therefore as in <unk> a complete boat ’ s crew must leave the ship , and hence as the boat <unk> or harpooneer is of the number , that <unk> is the steersman upon the occasion , and the captain , having no place to sit in , is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree .
And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships , this standing captain is all alive to the importance of <unk> his dignity by <unk> his legs .
Nor is this any very easy matter ; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar <unk> him now and then in the small of his back , the <unk> <unk> by <unk> his knees in front .
He is thus completely <unk> before and behind , and can only expand himself sideways by <unk> down on his stretched legs ; but a sudden , violent pitch of the boat will often go far to <unk> him , because length of <unk> is nothing without corresponding breadth .
<unk> make a spread angle of two poles , and you cannot stand them up .
Then , again , it would never do in plain sight of the world ’ s riveted eyes , it would never do , I say , for this <unk> captain to be seen <unk> himself the slightest <unk> by catching hold of anything with his hands ; indeed , as token of his entire , buoyant <unk> , he generally carries his hands in his trowsers ’ pockets ; but perhaps being generally very large , heavy hands , he carries them there for <unk> .
Nevertheless there have occurred instances , well <unk> ones too , where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two , in a sudden squall say — to seize hold of the nearest oarsman ’ s hair , and hold on there like grim death .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Town-Ho ’ s Story .
( _ As told at the <unk> Inn . _ ) The Cape of Good Hope , and all the watery region round about there , is much like some <unk> four corners of a great <unk> , where you meet more <unk> than in any other part .
It was not very long after speaking the <unk> that another <unk> whaleman , the Town-Ho , * was encountered .
She was manned almost wholly by <unk> .
In the short <unk> that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick .
To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho ’ s story , which seemed <unk> to involve with the whale a certain wondrous , inverted <unk> of one of those so called <unk> of God which at times are said to <unk> some men .
This latter circumstance , with its own particular <unk> , forming what may be called the secret part of the <unk> about to be narrated , never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates .
For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself .
It was the private property of three <unk> white seamen of that ship , one of whom , it seems , <unk> it to Tashtego with <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but the following night Tashtego <unk> in his sleep , and revealed so much of it in that way , that when he was <unk> he could not well <unk> the rest .
Nevertheless , so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it , and by such a strange delicacy , to call it so , were they <unk> in this matter , that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never <unk> <unk> the Pequod ’ s main-mast .
<unk> in its proper place this darker <unk> with the story as <unk> narrated on the ship , the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on <unk> record .
* The ancient <unk> upon first <unk> a whale from the mast-head , still used by whalemen in hunting the famous <unk> <unk> .
For my humor ’ s sake , I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at Lima , to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends , one <unk> ’ s eve , smoking upon the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> Inn .
Of those fine <unk> , the young <unk> , Pedro and Sebastian , were on the closer terms with me ; and hence the <unk> questions they occasionally put , and which are duly answered at the time .
“ Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about <unk> to you , gentlemen , the Town-Ho , Sperm <unk> of Nantucket , was cruising in your Pacific here , not very many days ’ sail eastward from the <unk> of this good <unk> Inn .
She was somewhere to the northward of the Line .
One morning upon <unk> the pumps , according to daily usage , it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common .
They supposed a sword-fish had <unk> her , gentlemen .
But the captain , having some unusual reason for <unk> that rare good luck <unk> him in those latitudes ; and therefore being very <unk> to quit them , and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous , though , indeed , they could not find it after <unk> the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather , the ship still continued her <unk> , the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals ; but no good luck came ; more days went by , and not only was the leak yet <unk> , but it <unk> increased .
So much so , that now taking some alarm , the captain , making all sail , stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands , there to have his hull <unk> out and <unk> .
“ Though no small passage was before her , yet , if the <unk> chance <unk> , he did not at all fear that his ship would <unk> by the way , because his pumps were of the best , and being <unk> relieved at them , those <unk> men of his could easily keep the ship free ; never mind if the leak should double on her .
In truth , well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very <unk> breezes , the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in <unk> safety at her port without the <unk> of the least fatality , had it not been for the <unk> overbearing of Radney , the mate , a <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> vengeance of Steelkilt , a Lakeman and <unk> from <unk> .
“ ‘ Lakeman ! — <unk> !
<unk> , what is a Lakeman , and where is <unk> ? ’ said Don Sebastian , rising in his swinging mat of grass .
“ On the <unk> shore of our <unk> <unk> , Don ; but — I <unk> your courtesy — may be , you shall soon hear further of all that .
Now , gentlemen , in <unk> <unk> and <unk> ships , <unk> as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old <unk> to far Manilla ; this Lakeman , in the <unk> heart of our America , had yet been nurtured by all those <unk> <unk> impressions popularly connected with the open ocean .
For in their <unk> <unk> , those grand <unk> seas of ours , — <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , — possess an <unk> <unk> , with many of the ocean ’ s <unk> <unk> ; with many of its <unk> varieties of <unk> and of climes .
They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles , even as the <unk> waters do ; in large part , are <unk> by two great contrasting nations , as the Atlantic is ; they furnish long maritime <unk> to our numerous <unk> <unk> from the East , dotted all round their <unk> ; here and there are <unk> upon by <unk> , and by the <unk> <unk> <unk> of lofty <unk> ; they have heard the fleet <unk> of <unk> <unk> ; at intervals , they yield their <unk> to wild <unk> , whose red painted faces flash from out their <unk> <unk> ; for leagues and leagues are <unk> by ancient and <unk> forests , where the gaunt <unk> stand like <unk> lines of kings in Gothic <unk> ; those same woods <unk> wild <unk> beasts of prey , and <unk> creatures whose <unk> <unk> give robes to Tartar Emperors ; they mirror the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , as well as <unk> <unk> ; they float alike the <unk> merchant ship , the armed <unk> of the State , the <unk> , and the <unk> canoe ; they are swept by <unk> and <unk> <unk> as direful as any that lash the salted wave ; they know what <unk> are , for out of sight of land , however inland , they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its <unk> crew .
Thus , gentlemen , though an <unk> , Steelkilt was <unk> born , and <unk> nurtured ; as much of an audacious mariner as any .
And for Radney , though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach , to <unk> at his maternal sea ; though in after life he had long followed our <unk> Atlantic and your <unk> Pacific ; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social <unk> as the <unk> seaman , fresh from the latitudes of <unk> handled <unk> .
Yet was this Nantucketer a man with some <unk> <unk> ; and this Lakeman , a mariner , who though a sort of devil indeed , might yet by <unk> <unk> , only <unk> by that common <unk> of human <unk> which is the meanest slave ’ s right ; thus treated , this Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and <unk> .
At all events , he had proved so thus far ; but Radney was <unk> and made mad , and Steelkilt — but , gentlemen , you shall hear .
“ It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven , that the Town-Ho ’ s leak seemed again increasing , but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day .
You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic , for example , some <unk> think little of <unk> their whole way across it ; though of a still , sleepy night , should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect , the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it , on account of all hands gently <unk> to the bottom .
Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the <unk> , gentlemen , is it altogether unusual for ships to keep <unk> at their <unk> in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length ; that is , if it lie along a <unk> <unk> coast , or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them .
It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters , some really <unk> latitude , that her captain begins to feel a little anxious .
“ Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho ; so when her leak was found gaining once more , there was in truth some small concern <unk> by several of her company ; especially by Radney the mate .
He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted , <unk> home anew , and every way expanded to the breeze .
Now this Radney , I suppose , was as little of a coward , and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless , <unk> creature on land or on sea that you can <unk> imagine , gentlemen .
Therefore when he betrayed this <unk> about the safety of the ship , some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her .
So when they were working that evening at the pumps , there was on this head no small <unk> <unk> going on among them , as they stood with their feet continually <unk> by the <unk> clear water ; clear as any mountain spring , gentlemen — that <unk> from the pumps ran across the deck , and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee <unk> .
“ Now , as you well know , it is not seldom the case in this <unk> world of ours — watery or otherwise ; that when a person placed in command over his <unk> finds one of them to be very <unk> his superior in general pride of <unk> , straightway against that man he <unk> an unconquerable <unk> and <unk> ; and if he have a chance he will pull down and <unk> that <unk> ’ s tower , and make a little <unk> of dust of it .
Be this conceit of mine as it may , gentlemen , at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman , and a <unk> golden beard like the <unk> <unk> of your last <unk> ’ s <unk> <unk> ; and a brain , and a heart , and a soul in him , gentlemen , which had made Steelkilt <unk> , had he been born son to <unk> ’ s father .
But Radney , the mate , was <unk> as a <unk> ; yet as hardy , as stubborn , as malicious .
He did not love Steelkilt , and Steelkilt knew it .
“ <unk> the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the <unk> with the rest , the Lakeman affected not to notice him , but <unk> , went on with his gay <unk> .
“ ‘ Aye , aye , my merry lads , it ’ s a lively leak this ; hold a <unk> , one of ye , and let ’ s have a taste .
By the Lord , it ’ s worth <unk> !
I tell ye what , men , old <unk> ’ s <unk> must go for it !
he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home .
The fact is , boys , that sword-fish only began the job ; he ’ s come back again with a <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and what not ; and the whole <unk> of ’ em are now hard at work cutting and <unk> at the bottom ; making <unk> , I suppose .
If old <unk> were here now , I ’ d tell him to jump overboard and <unk> ’ em .
They ’ re playing the devil with his <unk> , I can tell him .
But he ’ s a simple old soul , — <unk> , and a beauty too .
<unk> , they say the rest of his property is invested in <unk> .
I wonder if he ’ d give a poor devil like me the model of his nose . ’ “ ‘ Damn your eyes !
what ’ s that <unk> stopping for ? ’ roared Radney , <unk> not to have heard the sailors ’ talk .
‘ Thunder away at it ! ’ “ ‘ Aye , aye , sir , ’ said Steelkilt , merry as a <unk> .
‘ <unk> , boys , lively , now ! ’ And with that the <unk> <unk> like fifty <unk> ; the men tossed their hats off to it , and ere long that peculiar <unk> of the lungs was heard which <unk> the fullest <unk> of life ’ s utmost <unk> .
“ <unk> the <unk> at last , with the rest of his band , the Lakeman went forward all <unk> , and sat himself down on the windlass ; his face fiery red , his eyes <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> <unk> from his brow .
Now what <unk> fiend it was , gentlemen , that possessed Radney to <unk> with such a man in that <unk> exasperated state , I know not ; but so it happened .
<unk> striding along the deck , the mate commanded him to get a <unk> and sweep down the planks , and also a <unk> , and remove some <unk> matters <unk> upon <unk> a <unk> to run at large .
“ Now , gentlemen , sweeping a ship ’ s deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging <unk> is regularly attended to every evening ; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually <unk> at the time .
Such , gentlemen , is the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> love of <unk> in seamen ; some of whom would not willingly drown without first <unk> their faces .
But in all vessels this <unk> business is the <unk> <unk> of the boys , if boys there be aboard .
Besides , it was the <unk> men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into <unk> , taking turns at the pumps ; and being the most <unk> seaman of them all , Steelkilt had been regularly <unk> captain of one of the <unk> ; <unk> he should have been <unk> from any <unk> business not connected with truly <unk> <unk> , such being the case with his comrades .
I mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men .
“ But there was more than this : the order about the <unk> was almost as plainly meant to <unk> and insult Steelkilt , as though Radney had <unk> in his face .
Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand this ; and all this and doubtless much more , the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate <unk> his command .
But as he sat still for a moment , and as he steadfastly looked into the mate ’ s <unk> eye and perceived the <unk> of <unk> <unk> up in him and the <unk> silently burning along towards them ; as he instinctively saw all this , that strange <unk> and <unk> to <unk> up the deeper <unk> in any already <unk> being — a <unk> most felt , when felt at all , by really valiant men even when <unk> — this nameless phantom feeling , gentlemen , stole over Steelkilt .
“ Therefore , in his ordinary tone , only a little broken by the bodily <unk> he was temporarily in , he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business , and he would not do it .
And then , without at all <unk> to the <unk> , he pointed to three lads as the customary <unk> ; who , not being <unk> at the pumps , had done little or nothing all day .
To this , Radney replied with an oath , in a most <unk> and <unk> manner <unk> <unk> his command ; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman , with an uplifted cooper ’ s <unk> hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by .
“ <unk> and <unk> as he was by his <unk> toil at the pumps , for all his first nameless feeling of <unk> the <unk> Steelkilt could but ill <unk> this bearing in the mate ; but somehow still <unk> the <unk> within him , without speaking he remained <unk> rooted to his seat , till at last the <unk> Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face , furiously commanding him to do his bidding .
“ Steelkilt rose , and slowly <unk> round the windlass , steadily followed by the mate with his <unk> hammer , deliberately repeated his intention not to obey .
Seeing , however , that his <unk> had not the slightest effect , by an awful and unspeakable <unk> with his twisted hand he <unk> off the foolish and <unk> man ; but it was to no purpose .
And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass ; when , resolved at last no longer to retreat , bethinking him that he had now <unk> as much as <unk> with his humor , the Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer : “ ‘ Mr.
Radney , I will not obey you .
Take that hammer away , or look to yourself . ’ But the <unk> mate coming still closer to him , where the Lakeman stood fixed , now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth ; meanwhile <unk> a string of insufferable <unk> .
<unk> not the <unk> part of an inch ; <unk> him in the eye with the <unk> <unk> of his glance , Steelkilt , <unk> his right hand behind him and <unk> drawing it back , told his <unk> that if the hammer but <unk> his cheek he ( Steelkilt ) would murder him .
But , gentlemen , the fool had been branded for the <unk> by the gods .
<unk> the hammer touched the cheek ; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head ; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale .
“ Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the <unk> leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their <unk> .
They were both Canallers .
“ ‘ Canallers ! ’ cried Don Pedro .
‘ We have seen many whale-ships in our <unk> , but never heard of your Canallers .
<unk> : who and what are they ? ’ “ ‘ Canallers , Don , are the <unk> belonging to our grand <unk> <unk> .
You must have heard of it . ’ “ ‘ Nay , <unk> ; hereabouts in this dull , warm , most <unk> , and hereditary land , we know but little of your vigorous North . ’ “ ‘ Aye ?
Well then , Don , <unk> my cup .
Your <unk> ’ s very fine ; and ere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are ; for such information may throw <unk> upon my story . ’ “ For three hundred and sixty miles , gentlemen , through the entire breadth of the state of New York ; through numerous <unk> <unk> and most <unk> <unk> ; through long , dismal , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> fields , <unk> for <unk> ; by <unk> and bar-room ; through the <unk> of great forests ; on Roman <unk> over Indian <unk> ; through sun and shade ; by happy hearts or broken ; through all the wide contrasting <unk> of those noble <unk> <unk> ; and especially , by rows of snow-white <unk> , whose spires stand almost like <unk> , <unk> one continual stream of <unk> corrupt and often <unk> life .
There ’ s your true <unk> , gentlemen ; there <unk> your pagans ; where you ever find them , next door to you ; under the <unk> shadow , and the snug <unk> lee of churches .
For by some curious fatality , as it is often <unk> of your <unk> <unk> that they ever <unk> around the <unk> of <unk> , so sinners , gentlemen , most <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
“ ‘ Is that a <unk> passing ? ’ said Don Pedro , looking downwards into the <unk> <unk> , with humorous concern .
“ ‘ Well for our northern friend , <unk> <unk> ’ s <unk> <unk> in Lima , ’ laughed Don Sebastian .
‘ <unk> , <unk> . ’ “ ‘ A moment !
<unk> ! ’ cried another of the company .
‘ In the name of all us <unk> , I but desire to express to you , sir sailor , that we have by no means <unk> your delicacy in not <unk> present Lima for distant <unk> in your corrupt comparison .
Oh !
do not bow and look surprised ; you know the proverb all along this coast — “ <unk> as Lima . ” It but bears out your saying , too ; churches more <unk> than <unk> , and for ever open — and “ <unk> as Lima . ” So , too , <unk> ; I have been there ; the holy city of the blessed <unk> , St. Mark ! — St.
<unk> , <unk> it !
Your cup !
<unk> : here I <unk> ; now , you pour out again . ’ “ <unk> <unk> in his own vocation , gentlemen , the <unk> would make a fine <unk> <unk> , so <unk> and <unk> wicked is he .
Like Mark <unk> , for days and days along his <unk> , <unk> <unk> , he <unk> floats , <unk> <unk> with his <unk> <unk> , <unk> his <unk> thigh upon the sunny deck .
But ashore , all this <unk> is dashed .
The <unk> <unk> which the <unk> so <unk> <unk> ; his slouched and <unk> hat <unk> his grand features .
A terror to the <unk> innocence of the <unk> through which he floats ; his swart <unk> and bold <unk> are not <unk> in <unk> .
Once a <unk> on his own canal , I have received good turns from one of these Canallers ; I thank him <unk> ; would fain be not <unk> ; but it is often one of the prime <unk> qualities of your man of violence , that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a <unk> , as to <unk> a <unk> one .
In sum , gentlemen , what the <unk> of this canal life is , is <unk> evinced by this ; that our wild <unk> contains so many of its most finished <unk> , and that scarce any race of mankind , except <unk> men , are so much distrusted by our whaling captains .
Nor does it at all <unk> the <unk> of this matter , that to many thousands of our <unk> boys and young men born along its line , the <unk> life of the Grand <unk> <unk> the sole transition between quietly <unk> in a Christian <unk> , and recklessly <unk> the waters of the most barbaric seas .
“ ‘ I see !
I see ! ’ <unk> exclaimed Don Pedro , <unk> his <unk> upon his silvery <unk> .
‘ No need to travel !
The world ’ s one Lima .
I had thought , now , that at your <unk> North the generations were cold and holy as the hills . — But the story . ’ “ I left off , gentlemen , where the Lakeman shook the <unk> .
<unk> had he done so , when he was surrounded by the three <unk> mates and the four harpooneers , who all <unk> him to the deck .
But sliding down the ropes like <unk> <unk> , the two Canallers rushed into the <unk> , and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle .
<unk> of the sailors joined with them in this attempt , and a twisted <unk> ensued ; while standing out of harm ’ s way , the valiant captain <unk> up and down with a <unk> , calling upon his officers to <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and smoke him along to the quarter-deck .
At intervals , he ran close up to the revolving <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> into the heart of it with his <unk> , sought to prick out the object of his <unk> .
But Steelkilt and his <unk> were too much for them all ; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck , where , <unk> <unk> about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass , these <unk> <unk> themselves behind the <unk> .
“ ‘ Come out of that , ye pirates ! ’ roared the captain , now <unk> them with a pistol in each hand , just brought to him by the steward .
‘ Come out of that , ye <unk> ! ’ “ Steelkilt leaped on the <unk> , and striding up and down there , <unk> the <unk> the <unk> could do ; but gave the captain to understand distinctly , that his ( Steelkilt ’ s ) death would be the signal for a murderous <unk> on the part of all hands .
<unk> in his heart lest this might prove but too true , the captain a little <unk> , but still commanded the <unk> instantly to return to their duty .
“ ‘ Will you promise not to touch us , if we do ? ’ demanded their <unk> .
“ ‘ Turn to !
turn to ! — I make no promise ; — to your duty !
Do you want to sink the ship , by knocking off at a time like this ?
Turn to ! ’ and he once more raised a pistol .
“ ‘ <unk> the ship ? ’ cried Steelkilt .
‘ Aye , let her sink .
Not a man of us turns to , unless you swear not to raise a <unk> against us .
What say ye , men ? ’ turning to his comrades .
A fierce cheer was their <unk> .
“ The Lakeman now <unk> the <unk> , all the while keeping his eye on the Captain , and jerking out such <unk> as these : — ‘ It ’ s not our <unk> ; we didn ’ t want it ; I told him to take his hammer away ; it was boy ’ s business ; he might have known me before this ; I told him not to prick the buffalo ; I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw ; ain ’ t those <unk> knives down in the forecastle there , men ?
look to those handspikes , my <unk> .
Captain , by God , look to yourself ; say the word ; don ’ t be a fool ; forget it all ; we are ready to turn to ; <unk> us <unk> , and we ’ re your men ; but we won ’ t be <unk> . ’ “ ‘ Turn to !
I make no <unk> , turn to , I say ! ’ “ ‘ Look ye , now , ’ cried the Lakeman , flinging out his arm towards him , ‘ there are a few of us here ( and I am one of them ) who have shipped for the cruise , d ’ ye see ; now as you well know , sir , we can claim our <unk> as soon as the anchor is down ; so we don ’ t want a row ; it ’ s not our interest ; we want to be peaceable ; we are ready to work , but we won ’ t be <unk> . ’ “ ‘ Turn to ! ’ roared the Captain .
“ Steelkilt glanced round him a moment , and then said : — ‘ I tell you what it is now , Captain , rather than kill ye , and be hung for such a <unk> rascal , we won ’ t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us ; but till you say the word about not <unk> us , we don ’ t do a hand ’ s turn . ’ “ ‘ Down into the forecastle then , down with ye , I ’ ll keep ye there till ye ’ re sick of it .
Down ye go . ’ “ ‘ Shall we ? ’ cried the <unk> to his men .
Most of them were against it ; but at length , in obedience to Steelkilt , they <unk> him down into their dark den , <unk> <unk> , like bears into a cave .
“ As the Lakeman ’ s bare head was just level with the planks , the Captain and his <unk> leaped the <unk> , and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle , planted their <unk> of hands upon it , and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy <unk> <unk> belonging to the <unk> .
Then opening the slide a little , the Captain whispered something down the crack , closed it , and turned the key upon them — ten in number — leaving on deck some twenty or more , who thus far had remained <unk> .
“ All night a <unk> watch was kept by all the officers , forward and aft , especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway ; at which last place it was <unk> the <unk> might <unk> , after breaking through the <unk> below .
But the hours of darkness passed in peace ; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps , whose <unk> and <unk> at intervals through the dreary night <unk> <unk> through the ship .
“ At sunrise the Captain went forward , and knocking on the deck , summoned the <unk> to work ; but with a <unk> they <unk> .
Water was then lowered down to them , and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it ; when again turning the key upon them and <unk> it , the Captain returned to the quarter-deck .
<unk> every day for three days this was repeated ; but on the fourth morning a <unk> <unk> , and then a <unk> was heard , as the customary <unk> was <unk> ; and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle , saying they were ready to turn to .
The <unk> <unk> of the air , and a <unk> <unk> , united perhaps to some fears of ultimate <unk> , had <unk> them to surrender at <unk> .
<unk> by this , the Captain <unk> his demand to the rest , but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his <unk> and <unk> himself where he belonged .
On the fifth morning three others of the <unk> bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to <unk> them .
Only three were left .
“ ‘ <unk> turn to , now ? ’ said the Captain with a <unk> <unk> .
“ ‘ <unk> us up again , will ye ! ’ cried Steelkilt .
“ ‘ Oh certainly , ’ said the Captain , and the key <unk> .
“ It was at this point , gentlemen , that enraged by the <unk> of seven of his former <unk> , and <unk> by the <unk> voice that had last hailed him , and maddened by his long <unk> in a place as black as the bowels of despair ; it was then that Steelkilt <unk> to the two Canallers , thus far apparently of one mind with him , to burst out of their hole at the next <unk> of the <unk> ; and armed with their keen <unk> knives ( long , <unk> , heavy <unk> with a handle at each end ) run <unk> from the bowsprit to the taffrail ; and if by any <unk> of <unk> possible , seize the ship .
For himself , he would do this , he said , whether they joined him or not .
That was the last night he should spend in that den .
But the <unk> met with no <unk> on the part of the other two ; they swore they were ready for that , or for any other mad thing , for anything in short but a surrender .
And what was more , they each insisted upon being the first man on deck , when the time to make the rush should come .
But to this their leader as fiercely <unk> , <unk> that <unk> for himself ; particularly as his two comrades would not yield , the one to the other , in the matter ; and both of them could not be first , for the ladder would but admit one man at a time .
And here , gentlemen , the foul play of these <unk> must come out .
“ Upon hearing the frantic <unk> of their leader , each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted , it would seem , upon the same piece of <unk> , namely : to be foremost in breaking out , in order to be the first of the three , though the last of the ten , to surrender ; and thereby secure whatever small chance of <unk> such conduct might <unk> .
But when Steelkilt made known his <unk> still to lead them to the last , they in some way , by some subtle <unk> of <unk> , mixed their before secret <unk> together ; and when their leader fell into a doze , <unk> opened their souls to each other in three <unk> ; and bound the sleeper with cords , and <unk> him with cords ; and <unk> out for the Captain at midnight .
“ <unk> murder at hand , and <unk> in the dark for the blood , he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle .
In a few minutes the scuttle was opened , and , bound hand and foot , the still struggling <unk> was <unk> up into the air by his <unk> <unk> , who at once <unk> the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder .
But all these were <unk> , and dragged along the deck like dead cattle ; and , side by side , were seized up into the <unk> rigging , like three quarters of meat , and there they hung till morning .
‘ Damn ye , ’ cried the Captain , pacing to and fro before them , ‘ the <unk> would not touch ye , ye <unk> ! ’ “ At sunrise he summoned all hands ; and <unk> those who had <unk> from those who had taken no part in the <unk> , he told the former that he had a good mind to <unk> them all round — thought , upon the whole , he would do so — he ought to — <unk> demanded it ; but for the present , considering their <unk> surrender , he would let them go with a <unk> , which he accordingly <unk> in the <unk> .
“ ‘ But as for you , ye <unk> <unk> , ’ turning to the three men in the rigging — ‘ for you , I mean to <unk> ye up for the <unk> ; ’ and , seizing a rope , he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two <unk> , till they yelled no more , but <unk> hung their heads sideways , as the two <unk> <unk> are drawn .
“ ‘ My wrist is <unk> with ye ! ’ he cried , at last ; ‘ but there is still rope enough left for you , my fine <unk> , that wouldn ’ t give up .
Take that <unk> from his mouth , and let us hear what he can say for himself . ’ “ For a moment the exhausted <unk> made a <unk> motion of his <unk> jaws , and then <unk> twisting round his head , said in a sort of <unk> , ‘ What I say is this — and mind it well — if you <unk> me , I murder you ! ’ “ ‘ Say ye so ?
then see how ye <unk> me ’ — and the Captain drew off with the rope to strike .
“ ‘ <unk> not , ’ hissed the Lakeman .
“ ‘ But I must , ’ — and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke .
“ Steelkilt here hissed out something , <unk> to all but the Captain ; who , to the amazement of all hands , started back , paced the deck rapidly two or three times , and then suddenly throwing down his rope , said , ‘ I won ’ t do it — let him go — cut him down : d ’ ye hear ? ’ “ But as the <unk> mates were hurrying to <unk> the order , a pale man , with a <unk> head , <unk> them — Radney the chief mate .
<unk> since the blow , he had <unk> in his berth ; but that morning , hearing the <unk> on the deck , he had <unk> out , and thus far had watched the whole scene .
Such was the state of his mouth , that he could hardly speak ; but mumbling something about _ his _ being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt , he snatched the rope and advanced to his <unk> foe .
“ ‘ You are a coward ! ’ hissed the Lakeman .
“ ‘ So I am , but take that . ’ The mate was in the very act of striking , when another <unk> stayed his uplifted arm .
He paused : and then pausing no more , made good his word , spite of Steelkilt ’ s <unk> , whatever that might have been .
The three men were then cut down , all hands were turned to , and , <unk> worked by the moody seamen , the iron pumps <unk> as before .
“ Just after dark that day , when one watch had retired below , a <unk> was heard in the forecastle ; and the two trembling <unk> running up , <unk> the cabin door , saying they <unk> not <unk> with the crew .
<unk> , <unk> , and <unk> could not drive them back , so at their own instance they were put down in the ship ’ s run for salvation .
Still , no sign of <unk> <unk> among the rest .
On the contrary , it seemed , that <unk> at Steelkilt ’ s <unk> , they had resolved to maintain the <unk> <unk> , obey all orders to the last , and , when the ship reached port , desert her in a body .
But in order to <unk> the <unk> end to the voyage , they all agreed to another thing — namely , not to sing out for whales , in case any should be discovered .
For , spite of her leak , and spite of all her other perils , the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads , and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment , as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground ; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat , and with his <unk> mouth seek to <unk> in death the vital jaw of the whale .
“ But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to <unk> this sort of <unk> in their conduct , he kept his own <unk> ( at least till all was over ) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had <unk> him in the <unk> of his heart .
He was in Radney the chief mate ’ s watch ; and as if the <unk> man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom , after the scene at the rigging , he insisted , against the express <unk> of the captain , upon resuming the head of his watch at night .
Upon this , and one or two other circumstances , Steelkilt <unk> built the plan of his revenge .
“ During the night , Radney had an <unk> way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter-deck , and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there , a little above the ship ’ s side .
In this attitude , it was well known , he sometimes <unk> .
There was a considerable <unk> between the boat and the ship , and down between this was the sea .
Steelkilt calculated his time , and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o ’ clock , in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed .
At his <unk> , he employed the interval in <unk> something very carefully in his watches below .
“ ‘ What are you making there ? ’ said a shipmate .
“ ‘ What do you think ?
what does it look like ? ’ “ ‘ Like a <unk> for your bag ; but it ’ s an odd one , seems to me . ’ “ ‘ Yes , rather <unk> , ’ said the Lakeman , holding it at arm ’ s length before him ; ‘ but I think it will answer .
<unk> , I haven ’ t enough twine , — have you any ? ’ “ But there was none in the forecastle .
“ ‘ Then I must get some from old <unk> ; ’ and he rose to go aft .
“ ‘ You don ’ t mean to go a <unk> to _ him ! _ ’ said a sailor .
“ ‘ Why not ?
Do you think he won ’ t do me a turn , when it ’ s to help himself in the end , shipmate ? ’ and going to the mate , he looked at him quietly , and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock .
It was given him — neither twine nor <unk> were seen again ; but the next night an iron ball , closely <unk> , partly rolled from the pocket of the Lakeman ’ s monkey jacket , as he was <unk> the coat into his hammock for a pillow .
<unk> hours after , his trick at the silent helm — nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready <unk> to the seaman ’ s hand — that fatal hour was then to come ; and in the <unk> soul of Steelkilt , the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse , with his forehead crushed in .
“ But , gentlemen , a fool saved the <unk> murderer from the bloody deed he had <unk> .
Yet complete revenge he had , and without being the <unk> .
For by a mysterious fatality , Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the <unk> thing he would have done .
“ It was just between <unk> and sunrise of the morning of the second day , when they were <unk> down the decks , that a <unk> <unk> man , drawing water in the <unk> , all at once shouted out , ‘ There she rolls !
there she rolls ! ’ <unk> , what a whale !
It was Moby Dick .
“ ‘ Moby Dick ! ’ cried Don Sebastian ; ‘ St.
<unk> !
Sir sailor , but do whales have <unk> ?
<unk> call you Moby Dick ? ’ “ ‘ A very white , and famous , and most deadly immortal monster , Don ; — but that would be too long a story . ’ “ ‘ How ?
how ? ’ cried all the young <unk> , crowding .
“ ‘ Nay , <unk> , <unk> — nay , nay !
I cannot <unk> that now .
Let me get more into the air , <unk> . ’ “ ‘ The <unk> !
the <unk> ! ’ cried Don Pedro ; ‘ our vigorous friend looks faint ; — fill up his empty glass ! ’ “ No need , gentlemen ; one moment , and I proceed . — Now , gentlemen , so suddenly <unk> the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship — <unk> of the <unk> among the crew — in the excitement of the moment , the <unk> man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster , though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads .
All was now a <unk> .
‘ The White Whale — the White Whale ! ’ was the cry from captain , mates , and harpooneers , who , <unk> by fearful <unk> , were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish ; while the <unk> crew eyed <unk> , and with <unk> , the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass , that <unk> up by a horizontal <unk> sun , shifted and <unk> like a living <unk> in the blue morning sea .
<unk> , a strange fatality <unk> the whole career of these events , as if <unk> <unk> out before the world itself was <unk> .
The <unk> was the bowsman of the mate , and when fast to a fish , it was his duty to sit next him , while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow , and haul in or <unk> the line , at the word of command .
Moreover , when the four boats were lowered , the mate ’ s got the start ; and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt , as he strained at his oar .
After a stiff pull , their harpooneer got fast , and , spear in hand , Radney sprang to the bow .
He was always a furious man , it seems , in a boat .
And now his <unk> cry was , to beach him on the whale ’ s topmost back .
Nothing loath , his bowsman hauled him up and up , through a blinding foam that <unk> two <unk> together ; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken <unk> , and <unk> over , spilled out the standing mate .
That instant , as he fell on the whale ’ s slippery back , the boat <unk> , and was dashed aside by the swell , while Radney was tossed over into the sea , on the other flank of the whale .
He struck out through the spray , and , for an instant , was dimly seen through that veil , wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick .
But the whale rushed round in a sudden <unk> ; seized the <unk> between his jaws ; and rearing high up with him , plunged headlong again , and went down .
“ Meantime , at the first <unk> of the boat ’ s bottom , the Lakeman had slackened the line , so as to drop astern from the <unk> ; calmly looking on , he thought his own thoughts .
But a sudden , terrific , downward jerking of the boat , quickly brought his knife to the line .
He cut it ; and the whale was free .
But , at some distance , Moby Dick rose again , with some <unk> of Radney ’ s red woollen shirt , caught in the teeth that had destroyed him .
All four boats gave chase again ; but the whale <unk> them , and finally wholly disappeared .
“ In good time , the Town-Ho reached her port — a savage , solitary place — where no civilized creature <unk> .
There , headed by the Lakeman , all but five or six of the <unk> deliberately deserted among the palms ; eventually , as it turned out , seizing a large double <unk> of the savages , and setting sail for some other harbor .
“ The ship ’ s company being <unk> to but a handful , the captain called upon the Islanders to <unk> him in the <unk> business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak .
But to such <unk> vigilance over their dangerous <unk> was this small band of <unk> <unk> , both by night and by day , and so extreme was the hard work they <unk> , that upon the vessel being ready again for sea , they were in such a <unk> condition that the captain <unk> not put off with them in so heavy a vessel .
After taking <unk> with his officers , he <unk> the ship as far off shore as possible ; loaded and ran out his two <unk> from the bows ; <unk> his muskets on the <unk> ; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril , took one man with him , and setting the sail of his best whale-boat , steered straight before the wind for Tahiti , five hundred miles distant , to <unk> a <unk> to his crew .
“ On the fourth day of the sail , a large canoe was descried , which seemed to have touched at a low isle of <unk> .
He steered away from it ; but the savage craft bore down on him ; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to , or he would run him under water .
The captain presented a pistol .
With one foot on each prow of the <unk> <unk> , the Lakeman laughed him to scorn ; <unk> him that if the pistol so much as <unk> in the lock , he would bury him in bubbles and foam .
“ ‘ What do you want of me ? ’ cried the captain .
“ ‘ Where are you bound ?
and for what are you bound ? ’ demanded Steelkilt ; ‘ no lies . ’ “ ‘ I am bound to Tahiti for more men . ’ “ ‘ Very good .
Let me board you a moment — I come in peace . ’ With that he leaped from the canoe , swam to the boat ; and <unk> the gunwale , stood face to face with the captain .
“ ‘ <unk> your arms , sir ; throw back your head .
Now , <unk> after me .
As soon as Steelkilt leaves me , I swear to beach this boat on yonder island , and remain there six days .
If I do not , may <unk> strike me ! ’ “ ‘ A pretty <unk> , ’ laughed the Lakeman .
‘ <unk> , <unk> ! ’ and leaping into the sea , he swam back to his comrades .
“ <unk> the boat till it was fairly <unk> , and drawn up to the <unk> of the <unk> trees , Steelkilt made sail again , and in due time arrived at Tahiti , his own place of <unk> .
There , luck <unk> him ; two ships were about to sail for France , and were <unk> in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed .
They <unk> ; and so for ever got the start of their former captain , had he been at all <unk> to work them <unk> <unk> .
“ Some ten days after the French ships sailed , the whale-boat arrived , and the captain was forced to <unk> some of the more civilized <unk> , who had been somewhat used to the sea .
<unk> a small native schooner , he returned with them to his vessel ; and finding all right there , again resumed his <unk> .
“ Where Steelkilt now is , gentlemen , none know ; but upon the island of Nantucket , the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which <unk> to give up its dead ; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him .
* * * * “ ‘ Are you through ? ’ said Don Sebastian , quietly .
“ ‘ I am , Don . ’ “ ‘ Then I <unk> you , tell me if to the best of your own <unk> , this your story is in substance really true ?
It is so passing wonderful !
Did you get it from an <unk> source ?
Bear with me if I seem to <unk> . ’ “ ‘ <unk> bear with all of us , sir sailor ; for we all join in Don Sebastian ’ s suit , ’ cried the company , with exceeding interest .
“ ‘ Is there a copy of the Holy <unk> in the <unk> Inn , gentlemen ? ’ “ ‘ Nay , ’ said Don Sebastian ; ‘ but I know a worthy priest near by , who will quickly <unk> one for me .
I go for it ; but are you well <unk> ?
this may grow too serious . ’ “ ‘ Will you be so good as to bring the priest also , Don ? ’ “ ‘ Though there are no <unk> in Lima now , ’ said one of the company to another ; ‘ I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the <unk> .
Let us <unk> more out of the moonlight .
I see no need of this . ’ “ ‘ <unk> me for running after you , Don Sebastian ; but may I also <unk> that you will be particular in <unk> the largest sized <unk> you can . ’ * * * * * * “ ‘ This is the priest , he <unk> you the <unk> , ’ said Don Sebastian , <unk> , returning with a tall and solemn figure .
“ ‘ Let me remove my hat .
Now , venerable priest , further into the light , and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it .
“ ‘ So help me Heaven , and on my honor the story I have told ye , gentlemen , is in substance and its great items , true .
I know it to be true ; it happened on this ball ; I trod the ship ; I knew the crew ; I have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney . ’ ” CHAPTER <unk> .
Of the <unk> Pictures of Whales .
I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas , something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there .
It may be worth while , therefore , previously to <unk> to those curious <unk> <unk> of him which even down to the present day <unk> <unk> the faith of the landsman .
It is time to set the world right in this matter , by <unk> such pictures of the whale all wrong .
It may be that the primal source of all those <unk> <unk> will be found among the oldest Hindoo , Egyptian , and <unk> <unk> .
For ever since those <unk> but <unk> times when on the marble <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , and on <unk> , <unk> , cups , and coins , the dolphin was drawn in scales of <unk> like <unk> ’ s , and a <unk> head like St. George ’ s ; ever since then has something of the same sort of license <unk> , not only in most popular pictures of the whale , but in many scientific <unk> of him .
Now , by all odds , the most ancient <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be the whale ’ s , is to be found in the famous <unk> of <unk> , in India .
The <unk> maintain that in the almost endless <unk> of that immemorial <unk> , all the <unk> and <unk> , every <unk> <unk> of man , were <unk> ages before any of them actually came into being .
No wonder then , that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there <unk> forth .
The Hindoo whale <unk> to , <unk> in a separate <unk> of the wall , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> in the form of leviathan , <unk> known as the <unk> <unk> .
But though this <unk> is half man and half whale , so as only to give the tail of the latter , yet that small <unk> of him is all wrong .
It looks more like the tapering tail of an <unk> , than the broad palms of the true whale ’ s majestic flukes .
But go to the old <unk> , and look now at a great Christian <unk> ’ s <unk> of this fish ; for he <unk> no better than the <unk> Hindoo .
It is <unk> ’ s picture of Perseus <unk> <unk> from the <unk> or whale .
Where did <unk> get the model of such a strange creature as that ?
Nor does <unk> , in painting the same scene in his own “ Perseus <unk> , ” make out one <unk> better .
The huge <unk> of that <unk> monster <unk> on the surface , scarcely drawing one inch of water .
It has a sort of <unk> on its back , and its distended <unk> mouth into which the billows are rolling , might be taken for the <unk> ’ <unk> leading from the <unk> by water into the <unk> .
Then , there are the <unk> whales of old <unk> <unk> , and Jonah ’ s whale , as <unk> in the <unk> of old <unk> and the <unk> of old <unk> .
What shall be said of these ?
As for the <unk> ’ s whale winding like a <unk> round the stock of a descending anchor — as <unk> and <unk> on the backs and <unk> of many books both old and new — that is a very <unk> but <unk> fabulous creature , <unk> , I take it , from the like figures on antique <unk> .
Though <unk> denominated a dolphin , I nevertheless call this <unk> ’ s fish an attempt at a whale ; because it was so intended when the <unk> was first introduced .
It was introduced by an old <unk> <unk> somewhere about the <unk> century , during the <unk> of <unk> ; and in those days , and even down to a comparatively late period , <unk> were popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan .
In the <unk> and other <unk> of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious <unk> at the whale , where all manner of spouts , jets d ’ <unk> , hot <unk> and cold , <unk> and <unk> , come <unk> up from his <unk> brain .
In the <unk> of the original <unk> of the “ <unk> of <unk> ” you will find some curious whales .
But <unk> all these <unk> attempts , let us glance at those pictures of leviathan <unk> to be sober , scientific <unk> , by those who know .
In old Harris ’ s collection of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages , A.D. <unk> , entitled “ A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship <unk> in the Whale , Peter <unk> of <unk> , master . ” In one of those plates the whales , like great <unk> of <unk> , are <unk> lying among <unk> , with white bears running over their living backs .
In another plate , the prodigious <unk> is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes .
Then again , there is an imposing <unk> , written by one Captain Colnett , a <unk> Captain in the English navy , entitled “ A Voyage round Cape Horn into the South Seas , for the purpose of extending the <unk> Whale <unk> . ” In this book is an outline <unk> to be a “ <unk> of a <unk> or <unk> whale , drawn by <unk> from one killed on the coast of <unk> , August , <unk> , and hoisted on deck . ” I doubt not the captain had this <unk> picture taken for the <unk> of his <unk> .
To mention but one thing about it , let me say that it has an eye which applied , according to the accompanying <unk> , to a full grown sperm whale , would make the eye of that whale a <unk> some five feet long .
Ah , my gallant captain , why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye !
Nor are the most conscientious <unk> of Natural History for the <unk> of the young and tender , free from the same <unk> of mistake .
Look at that popular work “ <unk> ’ s <unk> Nature . ” In the <unk> London <unk> of <unk> , there are plates of an alleged “ whale ” and a “ <unk> . ” I do not wish to seem <unk> , but this <unk> whale looks much like an <unk> <unk> ; and , as for the <unk> , one glimpse at it is enough to <unk> one , that in this <unk> century such a <unk> could be <unk> for <unk> upon any intelligent public of <unk> .
Then , again , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> de <unk> , a great <unk> , published a scientific <unk> whale book , wherein are several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan .
All these are not only <unk> , but the picture of the <unk> or Greenland whale ( that is to say , the Right whale ) , even Scoresby , a long experienced man as touching that species , <unk> not to have its <unk> in nature .
But the placing of the <unk> to all this <unk> business was reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier , brother to the famous Baron .
In <unk> , he published a Natural History of Whales , in which he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale .
<unk> showing that picture to any Nantucketer , you had best provide for your <unk> retreat from Nantucket .
In a word , Frederick Cuvier ’ s Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale , but a <unk> .
Of course , he never had the <unk> of a whaling voyage ( such men seldom have ) , but whence he derived that picture , who can tell ?
Perhaps he got it as his scientific <unk> in the same field , <unk> , got one of his <unk> <unk> ; that is , from a Chinese drawing .
And what sort of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are , many queer cups and <unk> <unk> us .
As for the <unk> ’ whales seen in the streets hanging over the <unk> of <unk> , what shall be said of them ?
They are generally <unk> III .
whales , with <unk> <unk> , and very savage ; <unk> on three or four sailor <unk> , that is <unk> full of mariners : their <unk> <unk> in seas of blood and blue paint .
But these <unk> <unk> in <unk> the whale are not so very surprising after all .
Consider !
Most of the scientific <unk> have been taken from the stranded fish ; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship , with broken back , would correctly <unk> the noble animal itself in all its <unk> pride of hull and spars .
Though elephants have stood for their <unk> , the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his <unk> .
The living whale , in his full majesty and significance , is only to be seen at sea in <unk> waters ; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight , like a launched <unk> ship ; and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air , so as to preserve all his mighty swells and <unk> .
And , not to speak of the highly <unk> difference of <unk> between a young sucking whale and a full-grown <unk> Leviathan ; yet , even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship ’ s deck , such is then the outlandish , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> shape of him , that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch .
But it may be fancied , that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale , <unk> hints may be derived touching his true form .
Not at all .
For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan , that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape .
Though <unk> <unk> ’ s skeleton , which hangs for <unk> in the <unk> of one of his <unk> , correctly <unk> the idea of a <unk> <unk> old gentleman , with all <unk> ’ s other leading personal <unk> ; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan ’ s <unk> bones .
In fact , as the great Hunter says , the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same <unk> to the fully invested and <unk> animal as the <unk> does to the <unk> that so <unk> <unk> it .
This peculiarity is <unk> evinced in the head , as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown .
It is also very curiously <unk> in the side fin , the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand , <unk> only the <unk> .
This fin has four regular <unk> , the <unk> , middle , ring , and little finger .
But all these are <unk> lodged in their <unk> covering , as the human fingers in an artificial covering .
“ However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us , ” said humorous Stubb one day , “ he can never be truly said to handle us without <unk> . ” For all these reasons , then , any way you may look at it , you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain <unk> to the last .
True , one <unk> may hit the mark much nearer than another , but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of <unk> .
So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like .
And the only <unk> in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living <unk> , is by going a whaling yourself ; but by so doing , you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him .
Wherefore , it seems to me you had best not be too <unk> in your curiosity touching this Leviathan .
CHAPTER <unk> .
Of the <unk> <unk> Pictures of Whales , and the True Pictures of Whaling <unk> .
In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales , I am strongly <unk> here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books , both ancient and modern , especially in Pliny , <unk> , <unk> , Harris , Cuvier , <unk> .
But I pass that matter by .
I know of only four published <unk> of the great Sperm Whale ; Colnett ’ s , <unk> ’ s , Frederick Cuvier ’ s , and Beale ’ s .
In the previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been <unk> to .
<unk> ’ s is far better than theirs ; but , by great odds , Beale ’ s is the best .
All Beale ’ s <unk> of this whale are good , <unk> the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes , <unk> his second chapter .
His <unk> , boats <unk> Sperm Whales , though no doubt calculated to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of some parlor men , is <unk> correct and <unk> in its general effect .
Some of the Sperm Whale <unk> in <unk> <unk> Browne are pretty correct in <unk> ; but they are <unk> <unk> .
That is not his <unk> though .
Of the Right Whale , the best outline pictures are in Scoresby ; but they are drawn on too small a <unk> to <unk> a <unk> impression .
He has but one picture of whaling scenes , and this is a sad <unk> , because it is by such pictures only , when at all well done , that you can derive anything like a <unk> idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters .
But , taken for all in all , by far the finest , though in some <unk> not the most correct , <unk> of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found , are two large French engravings , well <unk> , and taken from <unk> by one <unk> .
<unk> , they <unk> <unk> on the Sperm and Right Whale .
In the first <unk> a noble Sperm Whale is <unk> in full majesty of might , just <unk> beneath the boat from the <unk> of the ocean , and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the <unk> planks .
The prow of the boat is <unk> <unk> , and is drawn just <unk> upon the monster ’ s spine ; and standing in that prow , for that one single <unk> flash of time , you behold an oarsman , half shrouded by the <unk> boiling spout of the whale , and in the act of leaping , as if from a <unk> .
The action of the whole thing is <unk> good and true .
The <unk> <unk> floats on the <unk> sea ; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely <unk> in it ; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting <unk> of <unk> ; while in the black <unk> distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene .
<unk> <unk> might be found with the anatomical <unk> of this whale , but let that pass ; since , for the life of me , I could not draw so good a one .
In the second <unk> , the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the <unk> flank of a large running Right Whale , that rolls his black <unk> bulk in the sea like some <unk> <unk> from the Patagonian <unk> .
His jets are erect , full , and black like <unk> ; so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney , you would think there must be a brave supper <unk> in the great bowels below .
Sea fowls are <unk> at the small <unk> , <unk> , and other sea <unk> and <unk> , which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his <unk> back .
And all the while the <unk> leviathan is rushing through the deep , leaving tons of tumultuous white <unk> in his wake , and <unk> the slight boat to rock in the swells like a <unk> caught nigh the <unk> of an ocean <unk> .
Thus , the <unk> is all raging commotion ; but behind , in admirable <unk> contrast , is the <unk> level of a sea <unk> , the drooping <unk> sails of the <unk> ship , and the <unk> mass of a dead whale , a <unk> <unk> , with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the <unk> inserted into his spout-hole .
Who <unk> the <unk> is , or was , I know not .
But my life for it he was either <unk> <unk> with his subject , or else <unk> <unk> by some experienced whaleman .
The French are the lads for painting action .
Go and gaze upon all the <unk> of Europe , and where will you find such a <unk> of living and breathing commotion on canvas , as in that <unk> <unk> at <unk> ; where the <unk> <unk> his way , <unk> , through the <unk> great <unk> of France ; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern <unk> , and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by , like a charge of <unk> <unk> ?
Not wholly unworthy of a place in that <unk> , are these sea <unk> of <unk> .
The natural <unk> of the French for seizing the <unk> of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what <unk> and engravings they have of their whaling scenes .
With not one tenth of England ’ s experience in the fishery , and not the <unk> part of that of the Americans , they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished <unk> at all capable of <unk> the real spirit of the whale hunt .
For the most part , the English and American whale <unk> seem entirely content with <unk> the mechanical outline of things , such as the vacant profile of the whale ; which , so far as <unk> of effect is concerned , is about <unk> to <unk> the profile of a pyramid .
Even Scoresby , the <unk> <unk> Right whaleman , after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale , and three or four delicate <unk> of <unk> and porpoises , <unk> us to a series of <unk> engravings of boat hooks , <unk> knives , and <unk> ; and with the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of a shivering world <unk> <unk> of <unk> Arctic snow <unk> .
I mean no <unk> to the excellent <unk> ( I honor him for a veteran ) , but in so important a matter it was certainly an <unk> not to have <unk> for every crystal a <unk> <unk> taken before a Greenland <unk> of the <unk> .
In <unk> to those fine engravings from <unk> , there are two other French engravings worthy of note , by some one who <unk> himself “ <unk>
<unk> . ” One of them , though not precisely adapted to our present purpose , nevertheless <unk> mention on other accounts .
It is a quiet <unk> among the isles of the Pacific ; a French whaler <unk> , <unk> , in a calm , and lazily taking water on board ; the <unk> sails of the ship , and the long leaves of the palms in the <unk> , both drooping together in the <unk> air .
The effect is very fine , when considered with reference to its <unk> the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose .
The other <unk> is quite a different affair : the ship <unk> upon the open sea , and in the very heart of the <unk> life , with a Right Whale alongside ; the vessel ( in the act of <unk> ) <unk> over to the monster as if to a <unk> ; and a boat , <unk> pushing off from this scene of activity , is about giving chase to whales in the distance .
The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use ; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole ; while from a sudden roll of the sea , the little craft stands <unk> out of the water , like a rearing horse .
From the ship , the smoke of the <unk> of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of <unk> ; and to windward , a black <unk> , rising up with earnest of squalls and <unk> , seems to <unk> the activity of the excited seamen .
CHAPTER <unk> .
Of Whales in <unk> ; in <unk> ; in <unk> ; in <unk> ; in <unk> ; in Mountains ; in <unk> .
On <unk> , as you go down to the London docks , you may have seen a <unk> <unk> ( or _ <unk> _ , as the sailors say ) holding a painted board before him , representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg .
There are three whales and three boats ; and one of the boats ( presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original <unk> ) is being <unk> by the jaws of the foremost whale .
Any time these ten years , they tell me , has that man held up that picture , and <unk> that stump to an incredulous world .
But the time of his <unk> has now come .
His three whales are as good whales as were ever published in <unk> , at any rate ; and his stump as <unk> a stump as any you will find in the western <unk> .
But , though for ever mounted on that stump , never a <unk> does the poor whaleman make ; but , with <unk> eyes , stands <unk> <unk> his own <unk> .
<unk> the Pacific , and also in Nantucket , and New Bedford , and Sag Harbor , you will come across lively <unk> of whales and <unk> , <unk> by the fishermen themselves on Sperm <unk> , or ladies ’ <unk> wrought out of the Right <unk> , and other like <unk> articles , as the whalemen call the numerous little <unk> contrivances they <unk> <unk> out of the rough material , in their hours of ocean <unk> .
Some of them have little boxes of <unk> <unk> , specially intended for the <unk> business .
But , in general , they toil with their <unk> alone ; and , with that almost omnipotent <unk> of the sailor , they will turn you out anything you please , in the way of a mariner ’ s fancy .
Long <unk> from Christendom and <unk> <unk> <unk> a man to that condition in which God placed him , _ <unk> _ what is called <unk> .
Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an <unk> .
I myself am a savage , <unk> no <unk> but to the King of the <unk> ; and ready at any moment to <unk> against him .
Now , one of the peculiar <unk> of the savage in his domestic hours , is his wonderful <unk> of <unk> .
An ancient <unk> <unk> or <unk> , in its full <unk> and <unk> of carving , is as great a <unk> of human <unk> as a Latin <unk> .
For , with but a bit of broken <unk> or a shark ’ s tooth , that miraculous <unk> of wooden <unk> has been achieved ; and it has cost steady years of steady application .
As with the <unk> savage , so with the white <unk> .
With the same marvellous <unk> , and with the same single shark ’ s tooth , of his one poor jack-knife , he will <unk> you a bit of bone <unk> , not quite as <unk> , but as close packed in its <unk> of design , as the Greek savage , <unk> ’ s <unk> ; and full of barbaric spirit and <unk> , as the <unk> of that fine old Dutch savage , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> whales , or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble South Sea <unk> , are frequently met with in the <unk> of American whalers .
Some of them are done with much <unk> .
At some old <unk> country houses you will see <unk> whales hung by the tail for <unk> to the <unk> door .
When the <unk> is sleepy , the <unk> whale would be best .
But these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful <unk> .
On the spires of some old-fashioned churches you will see <unk> whales placed there for <unk> ; but they are so elevated , and besides that are to all <unk> and <unk> so <unk> with “ _ Hands off ! _ ” you cannot <unk> them closely enough to <unk> upon their <unk> .
In bony , <unk> <unk> of the earth , where at the base of high broken <unk> masses of rock lie <unk> in <unk> <unk> upon the plain , you will often discover <unk> as of the <unk> forms of the Leviathan partly <unk> in grass , which of a <unk> day breaks against them in a surf of green <unk> .
Then , again , in <unk> countries where the traveller is continually <unk> by <unk> <unk> ; here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing <unk> of the <unk> of whales <unk> along the <unk> <unk> .
But you must be a <unk> whaleman , to see these sights ; and not only that , but if you wish to return to such a sight again , you must be sure and take the exact <unk> latitude and longitude of your first <unk> , else so <unk> are such <unk> of the hills , that your precise , previous <unk> would require a <unk> <unk> ; like the <unk> Islands , which still remain <unk> , though once <unk> <unk> trod them and old <unk> <unk> them .
Nor when <unk> lifted by your subject , can you fail to trace out great whales in the <unk> heavens , and boats in pursuit of them ; as when long filled with thoughts of war the <unk> nations saw <unk> locked in battle among the clouds .
Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round and round the <unk> with the <unk> of the bright points that first <unk> him to me .
And beneath the <unk> Antarctic skies I have boarded the <unk> , and joined the chase against the <unk> <unk> far beyond the utmost stretch of <unk> and the <unk> Fish .
With a frigate ’ s anchors for my <unk> and <unk> of harpoons for <unk> , would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies , to see whether the <unk> heavens with all their countless <unk> really lie <unk> beyond my mortal sight !
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> <unk> from the <unk> , we fell in with vast <unk> of brit , the minute , yellow substance , upon which the Right Whale largely feeds .
For leagues and leagues it <unk> round us , so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden <unk> .
On the second day , numbers of Right Whales were seen , who , secure from the attack of a Sperm <unk> like the Pequod , with open jaws <unk> swam through the brit , which , adhering to the <unk> fibres of that wondrous <unk> blind in their mouths , was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip .
As morning mowers , who side by side slowly and <unk> advance their <unk> through the long wet grass of <unk> <unk> ; even so these monsters swam , making a strange , <unk> , cutting sound ; and leaving behind them endless <unk> of blue upon the yellow sea .
* * That part of the sea known among whalemen as the “ <unk> Banks ” does not bear that name as the Banks of <unk> do , because of there being <unk> and soundings there , but because of this remarkable <unk> appearance , caused by the vast <unk> of brit continually floating in those latitudes , where the Right Whale is often chased .
But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mowers .
<unk> from the mast-heads , especially when they paused and were stationary for a while , their vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else .
And as in the great hunting countries of India , the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the <unk> <unk> elephants without knowing them to be such , taking them for bare , <unk> <unk> of the soil ; even so , often , with him , who for the first time <unk> this species of the leviathans of the sea .
And even when recognised at last , their immense magnitude <unk> it very hard really to believe that such <unk> masses of <unk> can possibly be instinct , in all parts , with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse .
Indeed , in other respects , you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore .
For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea ; and though taking a broad general view of the thing , this may very well be ; yet coming to <unk> , where , for example , does the ocean furnish any fish that in <unk> <unk> to the sagacious <unk> of the dog ?
The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative <unk> to him .
But though , to landsmen in general , the native inhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded with emotions <unk> <unk> and <unk> ; though we know the sea to be an everlasting <unk> <unk> , so that <unk> sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one <unk> western one ; though , by vast odds , the most terrific of all mortal <unk> have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters ; though but a moment ’ s consideration will teach , that however baby man may <unk> of his science and skill , and however much , in a <unk> future , that science and skill may augment ; yet for ever and for ever , to the crack of doom , the sea will insult and murder him , and <unk> the <unk> , <unk> frigate he can make ; nevertheless , by the continual <unk> of these very impressions , man has lost that sense of the full <unk> of the sea which <unk> belongs to it .
The first boat we read of , floated on an ocean , that with <unk> vengeance had <unk> a whole world without leaving so much as a widow .
That same ocean rolls now ; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year .
Yea , foolish mortals , Noah ’ s flood is not yet <unk> ; two thirds of the fair world it yet <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the sea and the land , that a <unk> upon one is not a <unk> upon the other ?
<unk> terrors <unk> upon the <unk> , when under the feet of <unk> and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever ; yet not a modern sun ever sets , but in precisely the same manner the live sea <unk> up ships and crews .
But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it , but it is also a fiend to its own <unk> ; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own guests ; <unk> not the creatures which itself hath <unk> .
Like a savage <unk> that tossing in the <unk> <unk> her own <unk> , so the sea <unk> even the mightiest whales against the rocks , and leaves them there side by side with the split <unk> of ships .
No mercy , no power but its own <unk> it .
<unk> and <unk> like a mad battle steed that has lost its <unk> , the <unk> ocean <unk> the globe .
Consider the <unk> of the sea ; how its most dreaded creatures <unk> under water , <unk> for the most part , and <unk> hidden beneath the <unk> <unk> of azure .
Consider also the devilish <unk> and beauty of many of its most remorseless <unk> , as the <unk> <unk> shape of many species of sharks .
Consider , once more , the universal <unk> of the sea ; all whose creatures prey upon each other , carrying on eternal war since the world began .
Consider all this ; and then turn to this green , gentle , and most <unk> earth ; consider them both , the sea and the land ; and do you not find a strange <unk> to something in yourself ?
For as this appalling ocean <unk> the <unk> land , so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti , full of peace and joy , but <unk> by all the horrors of the half known life .
God keep thee !
<unk> not off from that isle , thou canst never return !
CHAPTER <unk> .
Squid .
<unk> <unk> through the <unk> of brit , the Pequod still held on her way <unk> towards the island of Java ; a gentle air <unk> her keel , so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that <unk> breeze , as three mild palms on a plain .
And still , at wide intervals in the silvery night , the lonely , <unk> jet would be seen .
But one transparent blue morning , when a <unk> almost preternatural spread over the sea , however <unk> with any <unk> calm ; when the long <unk> <unk> on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them , <unk> some <unk> ; when the <unk> waves whispered together as they softly ran on ; in this profound <unk> of the visible <unk> a strange <unk> was seen by Daggoo from the <unk> .
In the distance , a great white mass lazily rose , and rising higher and higher , and <unk> itself from the azure , at last gleamed before our prow like a <unk> , new slid from the hills .
Thus glistening for a moment , as slowly it <unk> , and sank .
Then once more <unk> , and silently gleamed .
It seemed not a whale ; and yet is this Moby Dick ?
thought Daggoo .
Again the phantom went down , but on <unk> once more , with a <unk> cry that startled every man from his <unk> , the negro yelled out — “ There !
there again !
there she breaches !
right ahead !
The White Whale , the White Whale ! ” Upon this , the seamen rushed to the <unk> , as in <unk> the <unk> rush to the <unk> .
<unk> in the <unk> sun , Ahab stood on the bowsprit , and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman , cast his eager glance in the direction <unk> aloft by the <unk> motionless arm of Daggoo .
Whether the flitting <unk> of the one still and solitary jet had gradually worked upon Ahab , so that he was now prepared to <unk> the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued ; however this was , or whether his eagerness betrayed him ; <unk> way it might have been , no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass , than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering .
The four boats were soon on the water ; Ahab ’ s in advance , and all swiftly pulling towards their prey .
Soon it went down , and while , with oars suspended , we were awaiting its <unk> , lo !
in the same spot where it sank , once more it slowly rose .
Almost <unk> for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick , we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind .
A vast <unk> mass , <unk> in length and breadth , of a glancing <unk> , lay floating on the water , <unk> long arms <unk> from its centre , and curling and twisting like a nest of <unk> , as if blindly to clutch at any <unk> object within reach .
No <unk> face or front did it have ; no <unk> token of either <unk> or instinct ; but <unk> there on the billows , an unearthly , <unk> , <unk> apparition of life .
As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again , Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk , with a wild voice exclaimed — “ Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him , than to have seen thee , thou white ghost ! ” “ What was it , Sir ? ” said Flask .
“ The great live <unk> , which , they say , few whale-ships ever beheld , and returned to their ports to tell of it . ” But Ahab said nothing ; turning his boat , he sailed back to the vessel ; the rest as silently following .
<unk> superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object , certain it is , that a glimpse of it being so very unusual , that circumstance has gone far to invest it with <unk> .
So <unk> is it beheld , that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean , yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form ; notwithstanding , they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food .
For though other species of whales find their food above water , and may be seen by man in the act of feeding , the spermaceti whale <unk> his whole food in unknown <unk> below the surface ; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what , precisely , that food consists .
At times , when closely pursued , he will <unk> what are supposed to be the detached arms of the <unk> ; some of them thus <unk> exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length .
They fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged <unk> <unk> by them to the bed of the ocean ; and that the sperm whale , unlike other species , is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it .
There seems some ground to imagine that the great <unk> of Bishop <unk> may <unk> <unk> itself into Squid .
The manner in which the Bishop <unk> it , as <unk> rising and sinking , with some other particulars he <unk> , in all this the two <unk> .
But much <unk> is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he <unk> it .
By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature , here spoken of , it is included among the <unk> of <unk> , to which , indeed , in certain external respects it would seem to belong , but only as the <unk> of the tribe .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Line .
With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described , as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented , I have here to speak of the <unk> , sometimes horrible whale-line .
The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp , slightly <unk> with tar , not <unk> with it , as in the case of ordinary ropes ; for while tar , as <unk> used , makes the hemp more <unk> to the <unk> , and also <unk> the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use ; yet , not only would the ordinary quantity too much <unk> the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be <unk> ; but as most seamen are beginning to learn , tar in general by no means <unk> to the rope ’ s <unk> or strength , however much it may give it <unk> and <unk> .
Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely <unk> hemp as a material for <unk> ; for , though not so <unk> as hemp , it is <unk> , and far more soft and elastic ; and I will add ( since there is an <unk> in all things ) , is much more <unk> and <unk> to the boat , than hemp .
<unk> is a dusky , dark fellow , a sort of Indian ; but Manilla is as a <unk> <unk> to behold .
The whale-line is only <unk> of an inch in thickness .
At first sight , you would not think it so strong as it really is .
By experiment its one and fifty yarns will each <unk> a weight of one hundred and twenty <unk> ; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons .
In length , the common sperm whale-line <unk> something over two hundred fathoms .
Towards the stern of the boat it is <unk> coiled away in the tub , not like the <unk> of a still though , but so as to form one round , <unk> mass of <unk> <unk> “ <unk> , ” or <unk> of <unk> <unk> , without any hollow but the “ heart , ” or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese .
As the least <unk> or <unk> in the coiling would , in running out , infallibly take somebody ’ s arm , leg , or entire body off , the utmost <unk> is used in <unk> the line in its tub .
Some harpooneers will <unk> almost an entire morning in this business , carrying the line high aloft and then <unk> it downwards through a block towards the tub , so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and <unk> .
In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one ; the same line being <unk> coiled in both tubs .
There is some advantage in this ; because these <unk> being so small they fit more readily into the boat , and do not strain it so much ; whereas , the American tub , nearly three feet in <unk> and of <unk> depth , makes a rather <unk> <unk> for a craft whose planks are but one <unk> in thickness ; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice , which will bear up a considerable distributed weight , but not very much of a <unk> one .
When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the American <unk> , the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great <unk> to present to the whales .
Both ends of the line are exposed ; the lower end <unk> in an <unk> or <unk> coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub , and hanging over its edge completely <unk> from everything .
This <unk> of the lower end is necessary on two accounts .
First : In order to <unk> the <unk> to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat , in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to <unk> to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon .
In these instances , the whale of course is shifted like a <unk> of ale , as it were , from the one boat to the other ; though the first boat always <unk> at hand to <unk> its <unk> .
Second : This <unk> is indispensable for common safety ’ s sake ; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat , and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single , smoking minute as he sometimes does , he would not stop there , for the <unk> boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the <unk> of the sea ; and in that case no <unk> would ever find her again .
<unk> lowering the boat for the chase , the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub , and passing round the loggerhead there , is again carried forward the entire length of the boat , resting <unk> upon the loom or handle of every man ’ s oar , so that it <unk> against his wrist in rowing ; and also passing between the men , as they <unk> sit at the opposite gunwales , to the <unk> chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat , where a wooden pin or <unk> the size of a common <unk> , <unk> it from slipping out .
From the chocks it hangs in a slight <unk> over the bows , and is then passed inside the boat again ; and some ten or twenty fathoms ( called <unk> ) being coiled upon the box in the bows , it <unk> its way to the gunwale still a little further aft , and is then attached to the <unk> — the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon ; but previous to that connexion , the <unk> goes through <unk> <unk> too <unk> to detail .
Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils , twisting and <unk> around it in almost every direction .
All the oarsmen are involved in its perilous <unk> ; so that to the timid eye of the landsman , they seem as Indian <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> their limbs .
Nor can any son of mortal woman , for the first time , seat himself amid those hempen <unk> , and while straining his utmost at the oar , bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted , and all these horrible <unk> be put in play like <unk> <unk> ; he cannot be thus <unk> without a shudder that makes the very <unk> in his bones to <unk> in him like a <unk> <unk> .
Yet <unk> — strange thing !
what cannot <unk> <unk> ? — <unk> <unk> , more merry <unk> , better <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , you never heard over your <unk> , than you will hear over the <unk> white cedar of the whale-boat , when thus hung in <unk> ’ s <unk> ; and , like the six <unk> of <unk> before King <unk> , the six men <unk> the crew pull into the jaws of death , with a <unk> around every neck , as you may say .
Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling <unk> — some few of which are <unk> <unk> — of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line , and lost .
For , when the line is darting out , to be seated then in the boat , is like being seated in the midst of the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> in full play , when every flying <unk> , and <unk> , and wheel , is <unk> you .
It is worse ; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils , because the boat is rocking like a <unk> , and you are pitched one way and the other , without the slightest warning ; and only by a certain <unk> <unk> and <unk> of volition and action , can you escape being made a <unk> of , and run away with where the <unk> sun himself could never <unk> you out .
Again : as the profound calm which only apparently <unk> and <unk> of the storm , is perhaps more awful than the storm itself ; for , indeed , the calm is but the <unk> and <unk> of the storm ; and contains it in itself , as the seemingly harmless <unk> holds the fatal powder , and the ball , and the <unk> ; so the <unk> repose of the line , as it silently <unk> about the oarsmen before being brought into <unk> play — this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair .
But why say more ?
All men live <unk> in <unk> .
All are born with <unk> round their <unk> ; but it is only when caught in the swift , sudden turn of death , that mortals <unk> the silent , subtle , <unk> perils of life .
And if you be a philosopher , though seated in the whale-boat , you would not at heart feel one <unk> more of terror , than though seated before your evening fire with a <unk> , and not a harpoon , by your side .
CHAPTER <unk> .
Stubb <unk> a Whale .
If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents , to Queequeg it was quite a different object .
“ When you see him ’ <unk> , ” said the savage , <unk> his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat , “ then you quick see him ’ <unk> whale . ” The next day was exceedingly still and <unk> , and with nothing special to <unk> them , the Pequod ’ s crew could hardly <unk> the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea .
For this part of the Indian Ocean through which we then were <unk> is not what whalemen call a lively ground ; that is , it <unk> <unk> <unk> of porpoises , <unk> , <unk> , and other <unk> <unk> of more <unk> waters , than those off the <unk> de la <unk> , or the <unk> ground off Peru .
It was my turn to stand at the <unk> ; and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds , to and fro I <unk> swayed in what seemed an enchanted air .
No <unk> could withstand it ; in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness , at last my soul went out of my body ; though my body still continued to sway as a <unk> will , long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn .
Ere <unk> altogether came over me , I had noticed that the seamen at the main and <unk> were already <unk> .
So that at last all three of us <unk> swung from the spars , and for every swing that we made there was a <unk> from below from the <unk> helmsman .
The waves , too , <unk> their indolent <unk> ; and across the wide trance of the sea , east <unk> to west , and the sun over all .
Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes ; like <unk> my hands grasped the shrouds ; some invisible , gracious <unk> preserved me ; with a shock I came back to life .
And lo !
close under our lee , not forty fathoms off , a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the <unk> hull of a frigate , his broad , <unk> back , of an <unk> hue , glistening in the sun ’ s rays like a mirror .
But lazily <unk> in the <unk> of the sea , and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet , the whale looked like a portly <unk> smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon .
But that pipe , poor whale , was thy last .
As if struck by some <unk> ’ s <unk> , the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into <unk> ; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel , simultaneously with the three <unk> from aloft , shouted forth the accustomed cry , as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air .
“ <unk> away the boats !
<unk> ! ” cried Ahab .
And obeying his own order , he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the <unk> .
The sudden <unk> of the crew must have alarmed the whale ; and ere the boats were down , <unk> turning , he swam away to the leeward , but with such a steady <unk> , and making so few <unk> as he swam , that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed , Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used , and no man must speak but in <unk> .
So seated like <unk> Indians on the gunwales of the boats , we swiftly but silently <unk> along ; the calm not <unk> of the noiseless sails being set .
Presently , as we thus glided in chase , the monster perpendicularly <unk> his tail forty feet into the air , and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up .
“ There go flukes ! ” was the cry , an announcement immediately followed by Stubb ’ s producing his match and <unk> his pipe , for now a <unk> was <unk> .
After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed , the whale rose again , and being now in advance of the <unk> ’ s boat , and much nearer to it than to any of the others , Stubb counted upon the honor of the capture .
It was obvious , now , that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers .
All silence of <unk> was therefore no longer of use .
<unk> were dropped , and oars came loudly into play .
And still puffing at his pipe , Stubb <unk> on his crew to the assault .
Yes , a mighty change had come over the fish .
All alive to his jeopardy , he was going “ head out ” ; that part obliquely projecting from the mad <unk> which he <unk> .
* * It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whale ’ s enormous head consists .
Though apparently the most massive , it is by far the most buoyant part about him .
So that with ease he <unk> it in the air , and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed .
Besides , such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head , and such the tapering <unk> <unk> of the lower part , that by obliquely <unk> his head , he thereby may be said to <unk> himself from a <unk> <unk> <unk> into a <unk> New York <unk> .
“ Start her , start her , my men !
Don ’ t hurry yourselves ; take plenty of time — but start her ; start her like <unk> , that ’ s all , ” cried Stubb , <unk> out the smoke as he spoke .
“ Start her , now ; give ’ em the long and strong stroke , Tashtego .
Start her , Tash , my boy — start her , all ; but keep cool , keep cool — <unk> is the word — easy , easy — only start her like grim death and grinning devils , and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their <unk> , boys — that ’ s all .
Start her ! ” “ <unk> !
<unk> ! ” <unk> the <unk> in reply , raising some old <unk> to the skies ; as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily <unk> forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian gave .
But his wild <unk> were answered by others quite as wild .
“ <unk> !
<unk> ! ” yelled Daggoo , straining forwards and backwards on his seat , like a pacing tiger in his <unk> .
“ <unk> !
<unk> ! ” howled Queequeg , as if <unk> his lips over a <unk> of <unk> ’ s steak .
And thus with oars and <unk> the keels cut the sea .
Meanwhile , Stubb <unk> his place in the <unk> , still <unk> his men to the onset , all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth .
Like <unk> they <unk> and they strained , till the welcome cry was heard — “ Stand up , Tashtego ! — give it to him ! ” The harpoon was hurled .
“ Stern all ! ” The oarsmen backed water ; the same moment something went hot and <unk> along every one of their wrists .
It was the <unk> line .
An instant before , Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead , whence , by reason of its increased rapid <unk> , a hempen blue smoke now <unk> up and <unk> with the steady <unk> from his pipe .
As the line passed round and round the loggerhead ; so also , just before reaching that point , it <unk> passed through and through both of Stubb ’ s hands , from which the <unk> , or squares of <unk> canvas sometimes worn at these times , had accidentally dropped .
It was like holding an enemy ’ s sharp <unk> sword by the blade , and that enemy all the time striving to <unk> it out of your clutch .
“ <unk> the line !
wet the line ! ” cried Stubb to the tub oarsman ( him seated by the tub ) who , snatching off his hat , dashed <unk> into it .
* More turns were taken , so that the line began holding its place .
The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins .
Stubb and Tashtego here changed places — <unk> for stern — a <unk> business truly in that rocking commotion .
* <unk> to show the <unk> of this act , it may here be stated , that , in the old Dutch fishery , a <unk> was used to dash the running line with water ; in many other ships , a wooden <unk> , or <unk> , is set apart for that purpose .
Your hat , however , is the most convenient .
From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat , and from its now being more tight than a <unk> , you would have thought the craft had two keels — one <unk> the water , the other the air — as the boat <unk> on through both opposing elements at once .
A continual <unk> <unk> at the bows ; a <unk> whirling <unk> in her wake ; and , at the slightest motion from within , even but of a little finger , the vibrating , cracking craft <unk> over her <unk> gunwale into the sea .
Thus they rushed ; each man with might and main clinging to his seat , to prevent being tossed to the foam ; and the tall form of Tashtego at the steering oar <unk> almost double , in order to bring down his centre of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> seemed passed as they shot on their way , till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight .
“ Haul in — haul in ! ” cried Stubb to the bowsman !
and , facing round towards the whale , all hands began pulling the boat up to him , while yet the boat was being towed on .
Soon ranging up by his flank , Stubb , firmly planting his knee in the clumsy <unk> , darted dart after dart into the flying fish ; at the word of command , the boat <unk> <unk> out of the way of the whale ’ s horrible <unk> , and then ranging up for another <unk> .
The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like <unk> down a hill .
His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood , which <unk> and <unk> for <unk> behind in their wake .
The <unk> sun playing upon this <unk> <unk> in the sea , sent back its reflection into every face , so that they all <unk> to each other like red men .
And all the while , jet after jet of white smoke was <unk> shot from the spiracle of the whale , and <unk> puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman ; as at every dart , hauling in upon his crooked lance ( by the line attached to it ) , Stubb straightened it again and again , by a few rapid blows against the gunwale , then again and again sent it into the whale .
“ Pull up — pull up ! ” he now cried to the bowsman , as the <unk> whale <unk> in his wrath .
“ Pull up ! — close to ! ” and the boat ranged along the fish ’ s flank .
When reaching far over the bow , Stubb slowly <unk> his long sharp lance into the fish , and kept it there , carefully churning and churning , as if <unk> seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed , and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out .
But that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish .
And now it is struck ; for , starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his “ <unk> , ” the monster <unk> <unk> in his blood , <unk> himself in <unk> , mad , boiling spray , so that the <unk> craft , instantly dropping astern , had much <unk> blindly to <unk> out from that <unk> twilight into the clear air of the day .
And now <unk> in his <unk> , the whale once more rolled out into view ; <unk> from side to side ; <unk> <unk> and <unk> his spout-hole , with sharp , cracking , <unk> <unk> .
At last , gush after gush of <unk> red <unk> , as if it had been the purple <unk> of red wine , shot into the <unk> air ; and falling back again , ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea .
His heart had burst !
“ He ’ s dead , Mr. Stubb , ” said Daggoo .
“ Yes ; both pipes smoked out ! ” and withdrawing his own from his mouth , Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water ; and , for a moment , stood <unk> eyeing the vast corpse he had made .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
A word concerning an incident in the last chapter .
According to the <unk> usage of the fishery , the whale-boat <unk> off from the ship , with the headsman or <unk> as temporary steersman , and the harpooneer or <unk> pulling the foremost oar , the one known as the <unk> .
Now it needs a strong , nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish ; for often , in what is called a long dart , the heavy <unk> has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet .
But however prolonged and <unk> the chase , the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost ; indeed , he is expected to set an example of <unk> activity to the rest , not only by incredible rowing , but by repeated loud and intrepid <unk> ; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one ’ s compass , while all the other muscles are strained and half started — what that is none know but those who have tried it .
For one , I cannot <unk> very <unk> and work very recklessly at one and the same time .
In this straining , <unk> state , then , with his back to the fish , all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the <unk> cry — “ Stand up , and give it to him ! ” He now has to drop and secure his oar , turn round on his centre half way , seize his harpoon from the crotch , and with what little strength may remain , he <unk> to pitch it somehow into the whale .
No wonder , taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body , that out of fifty fair chances for a dart , not five are successful ; no wonder that so many <unk> harpooneers are <unk> cursed and <unk> ; no wonder that some of them actually burst their <unk> in the boat ; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels ; no wonder that to many ship owners , whaling is but a losing concern ; for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage , and if you take the breath out of his body how can you <unk> to find it there when most wanted !
Again , if the dart be successful , then at the second critical instant , that is , when the whale <unk> to run , the <unk> and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft , to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else .
It is then they change places ; and the headsman , the chief officer of the little craft , takes his proper <unk> in the bows of the boat .
Now , I care not who <unk> the contrary , but all this is both foolish and unnecessary .
The headsman should stay in the bows from first to last ; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance , and no rowing whatever should be expected of him , except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman .
I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase ; but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast <unk> of <unk> in the fishery , it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described <unk> of the harpooneer that has caused them .
To <unk> the greatest <unk> in the dart , the harpooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of <unk> , and not from out of toil .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
Out of the trunk , the branches grow ; out of them , the <unk> .
So , in <unk> subjects , grow the chapters .
The crotch alluded to on a previous page <unk> independent mention .
It is a <unk> stick of a peculiar form , some two feet in length , which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow , for the purpose of <unk> a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon , whose other naked , barbed end <unk> <unk> from the prow .
<unk> the weapon is instantly at hand to its <unk> , who <unk> it up as readily from its rest as a <unk> swings his <unk> from the wall .
It is customary to have two harpoons <unk> in the crotch , <unk> called the first and second irons .
But these two harpoons , each by its own cord , are both connected with the line ; the object being this : to dart them both , if possible , one instantly after the other into the same whale ; so that if , in the coming drag , one should draw out , the other may still retain a hold .
It is a <unk> of the chances .
But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous , violent , <unk> running of the whale upon receiving the first iron , it becomes impossible for the harpooneer , however <unk> in his <unk> , to pitch the second iron into him .
Nevertheless , as the second iron is already connected with the line , and the line is running , hence that weapon must , at all events , be <unk> tossed out of the boat , somehow and somewhere ; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands .
<unk> into the water , it accordingly is in such cases ; the spare coils of box line ( mentioned in a preceding chapter ) making this feat , in most instances , <unk> practicable .
But this critical act is not always <unk> with the <unk> and most fatal <unk> .
<unk> : you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard , it <unk> becomes a <unk> , <unk> terror , <unk> <unk> about both boat and whale , <unk> the lines , or cutting them , and making a prodigious <unk> in all directions .
Nor , in general , is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse .
Consider , now , how it must be in the case of four boats all <unk> one unusually strong , active , and knowing whale ; when owing to these qualities in him , as well as to the thousand <unk> accidents of such an audacious <unk> , eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously <unk> about him .
For , of course , each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be <unk> darted without <unk> .
All these particulars are <unk> narrated here , as they will not fail to <unk> several most important , however <unk> <unk> , in scenes hereafter to be painted .
CHAPTER <unk> .
Stubb ’ s Supper .
Stubb ’ s whale had been killed some distance from the ship .
It was a calm ; so , forming a <unk> of three boats , we commenced the slow business of towing the <unk> to the Pequod .
And now , as we eighteen men with our <unk> arms , and one hundred and <unk> <unk> and fingers , slowly toiled hour after hour upon that <unk> , <unk> corpse in the sea ; and it seemed hardly to <unk> at all , except at long intervals ; good <unk> was hereby furnished of the <unk> of the mass we moved .
For , upon the great canal of <unk> , or whatever they call it , in China , four or five laborers on the <unk> will draw a <unk> <unk> <unk> at the rate of a mile an hour ; but this grand <unk> we towed heavily forged along , as if laden with <unk> in bulk .
<unk> came on ; but three lights up and down in the Pequod ’ s <unk> dimly <unk> our way ; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks .
<unk> eyeing the heaving whale for a moment , he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night , and then <unk> his lantern to a seaman , went his way into the cabin , and did not come forward again until morning .
Though , in <unk> the pursuit of this whale , Captain Ahab had evinced his customary activity , to call it so ; yet now that the creature was dead , some vague <unk> , or impatience , or despair , seemed working in him ; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain ; and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship , all that would not one jot advance his grand , monomaniac object .
Very soon you would have thought from the sound on the Pequod ’ s decks , that all hands were <unk> to cast anchor in the deep ; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck , and thrust rattling out of the <unk> .
But by those <unk> links , the vast corpse itself , not the ship , is to be moored .
<unk> by the head to the stern , and by the tail to the bows , the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel ’ s and seen through the darkness of the night , which <unk> the spars and rigging aloft , the two — ship and whale , seemed <unk> together like colossal <unk> , <unk> one <unk> while the other remains standing .
* * A little <unk> may as well be related here .
The strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside , is by the flukes or tail ; and as from its greater <unk> that part is <unk> <unk> than any other ( <unk> the <unk> ) , its <unk> even in death , <unk> it to sink low beneath the surface ; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat , in order to put the <unk> round it .
But this difficulty is <unk> <unk> : a small , strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end , and a weight in its middle , while the other end is secured to the ship .
By <unk> management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass , so that now having <unk> the whale , the <unk> is readily made to follow suit ; and being slipped along the body , is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail , at the point of <unk> with its broad flukes or <unk> .
If moody Ahab was now all <unk> , at least so far as could be known on deck , Stubb , his second mate , <unk> with <unk> , betrayed an unusual but still <unk> excitement .
Such an unwonted <unk> was he in that the <unk> Starbuck , his official superior , quietly <unk> to him for the time the sole management of affairs .
One small , helping cause of all this <unk> in Stubb , was soon made strangely <unk> .
Stubb was a high <unk> ; he was somewhat <unk> fond of the whale as a <unk> thing to his <unk> .
“ A steak , a steak , ere I sleep !
You , Daggoo !
overboard you go , and cut me one from his small ! ” Here be it known , that though these wild fishermen do not , as a general thing , and according to the great military <unk> , make the enemy <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the war ( at least before <unk> the proceeds of the voyage ) , yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers who have a <unk> <unk> for that particular part of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb ; comprising the tapering extremity of the body .
About midnight that steak was cut and cooked ; and lighted by two lanterns of sperm oil , Stubb <unk> stood up to his spermaceti supper at the <unk> , as if that capstan were a <unk> .
Nor was Stubb the only <unk> on whale ’ s flesh that night .
<unk> their <unk> with his own <unk> , thousands on thousands of sharks , <unk> round the dead leviathan , <unk> <unk> on its <unk> .
The few sleepers below in their <unk> were often startled by the sharp <unk> of their tails against the hull , within a few inches of the sleepers ’ hearts .
<unk> over the side you could just see them ( as before you heard them ) <unk> in the sullen , black waters , and turning over on their backs as they <unk> out huge globular pieces of the whale of the <unk> of a human head .
This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous .
How at such an apparently <unk> surface , they <unk> to <unk> out such <unk> <unk> , remains a part of the universal problem of all things .
The mark they thus leave on the whale , may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in <unk> for a <unk> .
Though amid all the smoking horror and <unk> of a <unk> , sharks will be seen <unk> gazing up to the ship ’ s decks , like <unk> dogs round a table where red meat is being carved , ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them ; and though , while the valiant <unk> over the <unk> are thus <unk> carving each other ’ s live meat with <unk> all <unk> and <unk> , the sharks , also , with their <unk> mouths , are <unk> carving away under the table at the dead meat ; and though , were you to turn the whole affair <unk> down , it would still be pretty much the same thing , that is to say , a <unk> <unk> business enough for all parties ; and though sharks also are the <unk> <unk> of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic , <unk> <unk> alongside , to be <unk> in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere , or a dead slave to be <unk> buried ; and though one or two other like instances might be set down , touching the set terms , places , and occasions , when sharks do most <unk> <unk> , and most <unk> feast ; yet is there no <unk> time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers , and in <unk> or more <unk> spirits , than around a dead sperm whale , moored by night to a <unk> at sea .
If you have never seen that sight , then <unk> your <unk> about the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> the devil .
But , as yet , Stubb heeded not the <unk> of the banquet that was going on so nigh him , no more than the sharks heeded the <unk> of his own <unk> lips .
“ Cook , cook ! — where ’ s that old Fleece ? ” he cried at length , <unk> his legs still further , as if to form a more secure base for his supper ; and , at the same time darting his <unk> into the dish , as if <unk> with his lance ; “ cook , you cook ! — sail this way , cook ! ” The old black , not in any very high <unk> at having been previously <unk> from his warm hammock at a most <unk> hour , came <unk> along from his <unk> , for , like many old <unk> , there was something the matter with his <unk> , which he did not keep well <unk> like his other <unk> ; this old Fleece , as they called him , came <unk> and <unk> along , <unk> his step with his tongs , which , after a clumsy fashion , were made of straightened iron hoops ; this old <unk> <unk> along , and in obedience to the word of command , came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb ’ s <unk> ; when , with both hands folded before him , and resting on his <unk> cane , he bowed his arched back still further over , at the same time sideways <unk> his head , so as to bring his best ear into play .
“ Cook , ” said Stubb , rapidly lifting a rather <unk> <unk> to his mouth , “ don ’ t you think this steak is rather <unk> ?
You ’ ve been beating this steak too much , cook ; it ’ s too tender .
Don ’ t I always say that to be good , a whale-steak must be tough ?
There are those sharks now over the side , don ’ t you see they <unk> it tough and rare ?
What a <unk> they are kicking up !
Cook , go and talk to ’ em ; tell ’ em they are welcome to help themselves <unk> , and in <unk> , but they must keep quiet .
Blast me , if I can hear my own voice .
Away , cook , and <unk> my <unk> .
Here , take this lantern , ” snatching one from his <unk> ; “ now then , go and preach to ’ em ! ” <unk> taking the offered lantern , old Fleece <unk> across the deck to the bulwarks ; and then , with one hand dropping his light low over the sea , so as to get a good view of his congregation , with the other hand he solemnly <unk> his tongs , and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began <unk> the sharks , while Stubb , softly crawling behind , <unk> all that was said .
“ <unk> : I ’ <unk> ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise dare .
You hear ?
Stop dat dam <unk> ’ <unk> de lip !
<unk> Stubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de <unk> , but by <unk> !
you must stop dat dam <unk> ! ” “ Cook , ” here <unk> Stubb , accompanying the word with a sudden <unk> on the shoulder , — “ Cook !
why , <unk> your eyes , you <unk> ’ t swear that way when you ’ re <unk> .
That ’ s no way to <unk> sinners , cook ! ” “ Who dat ?
<unk> preach to him yourself , ” <unk> turning to go .
“ No , cook ; go on , go on . ” “ Well , den , <unk> <unk> : ” — “ Right ! ” exclaimed Stubb , <unk> , “ <unk> ’ em to it ; try that , ” and Fleece continued .
“ Do you is all sharks , and by <unk> <unk> <unk> , yet I <unk> to you , <unk> , dat dat <unk> — ’ top dat dam <unk> ’ <unk> de tail !
How you <unk> to hear , <unk> you keep up such a dam <unk> ’ and <unk> ’ dare ? ” “ Cook , ” cried Stubb , <unk> him , “ I won ’ t have that swearing .
Talk to ’ em <unk> . ” Once more the <unk> proceeded .
“ Your <unk> , <unk> , I don ’ t <unk> ye so much for ; dat is <unk> , and can ’ t be helped ; but to <unk> dat wicked <unk> , dat is de <unk> .
You is sharks , <unk> ; but if you <unk> de shark in you , why den you be angel ; for all angel is not ’ <unk> more <unk> de shark well <unk> .
Now , look here , bred ’ <unk> , just try <unk> to be <unk> , a helping <unk> from dat whale .
Don ’ t be <unk> ’ de blubber out your <unk> ’ s <unk> , I say .
Is not one shark <unk> right as <unk> to dat whale ?
And , by <unk> , none on you has de right to dat whale ; dat whale belong to some one else .
I know some o ’ you has <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ; but den de <unk> <unk> sometimes has de small bellies ; so dat de <unk> of de <unk> is not to <unk> <unk> , but to bit off de blubber for de small <unk> <unk> sharks , dat can ’ t get into de <unk> to help <unk> . ” “ Well done , old Fleece ! ” cried Stubb , “ that ’ s <unk> ; go on . ” “ No use goin ’ on ; de dam <unk> will keep a <unk> ’ and <unk> ’ each <unk> , <unk> Stubb ; dey don ’ t hear one word ; no use <unk> ’ to such dam <unk> ’ <unk> as you call ’ em , till dare bellies is full , and dare bellies is bottomless ; and when dey do get ’ em full , dey wont hear you den ; for den dey sink in de sea , go fast to sleep on de coral , and can ’ t hear not ’ <unk> at all , no more , for <unk> and <unk> . ” “ Upon my soul , I am about of the same opinion ; so give the <unk> , Fleece , and I ’ ll away to my supper . ” Upon this , Fleece , holding both hands over the fishy mob , raised his <unk> voice , and cried — “ <unk> <unk> !
<unk> up de <unk> row as ever you can ; fill your dam ’ bellies ’ till dey <unk> — and den die . ” “ Now , cook , ” said Stubb , resuming his supper at the capstan ; “ stand just where you stood before , there , over against me , and pay particular attention . ” “ All <unk> , ” said Fleece , again stooping over upon his tongs in the desired position .
“ Well , ” said Stubb , helping himself freely meanwhile ; “ I shall now go back to the subject of this steak .
In the first place , how old are you , cook ? ” “ What dat do <unk> de ’ <unk> , ” said the old black , <unk> .
“ <unk> !
How old are you , cook ? ” “ ’ <unk> <unk> , dey say , ” he <unk> muttered .
“ And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years , cook , and don ’ t know yet how to cook a whale-steak ? ” rapidly <unk> another <unk> at the last word , so that <unk> seemed a <unk> of the question .
“ Where were you born , cook ? ” “ ’ <unk> de hatchway , in <unk> , goin ’ <unk> de <unk> . ” “ <unk> in a <unk> !
That ’ s queer , too .
But I want to know what country you were born in , cook ! ” “ Didn ’ t I say de <unk> country ? ” he cried <unk> .
“ No , you didn ’ t , cook ; but I ’ ll tell you what I ’ m coming to , cook .
You must go home and be born over again ; you don ’ t know how to cook a whale-steak yet . ” “ <unk> my soul , if I cook <unk> one , ” he <unk> , <unk> , turning round to depart .
“ Come back , cook ; — here , hand me those tongs ; — now take that bit of steak there , and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be ?
Take it , I say ” — holding the tongs towards him — “ take it , and taste it . ” <unk> <unk> his <unk> lips over it for a moment , the old negro muttered , “ <unk> cooked ’ <unk> I <unk> taste ; <unk> , <unk> <unk> . ” “ Cook , ” said Stubb , <unk> himself once more ; “ do you belong to the church ? ” “ <unk> one once in <unk> , ” said the old man <unk> .
“ And you have once in your life passed a holy church in <unk> , where you doubtless <unk> a holy <unk> <unk> his <unk> as his <unk> <unk> , have you , cook !
And yet you come here , and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now , eh ? ” said Stubb .
“ Where do you <unk> to go to , cook ? ” “ Go to bed <unk> soon , ” he <unk> , <unk> as he spoke .
“ Avast !
heave to !
I mean when you die , cook .
It ’ s an awful question .
Now what ’ s your answer ? ” “ When <unk> old <unk> man dies , ” said the negro slowly , <unk> his whole air and <unk> , “ he <unk> won ’ t go nowhere ; but some <unk> angel will come and fetch him . ” “ <unk> him ?
How ?
In a <unk> and four , as they <unk> Elijah ?
And fetch him where ? ” “ Up <unk> , ” said Fleece , holding his tongs straight over his head , and keeping it there very solemnly .
“ So , then , you <unk> to go up into our main-top , do you , cook , when you are dead ?
But don ’ t you know the higher you climb , the <unk> it gets ?
<unk> , eh ? ” “ Didn ’ t say dat t ’ all , ” said Fleece , again in the <unk> .
“ You said up there , didn ’ t you ?
and now look yourself , and see where your tongs are pointing .
But , perhaps you <unk> to get into heaven by crawling through the <unk> ’ s hole , cook ; but , no , no , cook , you don ’ t get there , except you go the regular way , round by the rigging .
It ’ s a <unk> business , but must be done , or else it ’ s no go .
But none of us are in heaven yet .
<unk> your tongs , cook , and hear my orders .
Do ye hear ?
Hold your hat in one hand , and <unk> t ’ other a ’ top of your heart , when I ’ m giving my orders , cook .
What !
that your heart , there ? — that ’ s your <unk> !
Aloft !
aloft ! — that ’ s it — now you have it .
Hold it there now , and pay attention . ” “ All ’ <unk> , ” said the old black , with both hands placed as desired , vainly wriggling his <unk> head , as if to get both ears in front at one and the same time .
“ Well then , cook , you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad , that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible ; you see that , don ’ t you ?
Well , for the future , when you cook another whale-steak for my private table here , the capstan , I ’ ll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by <unk> .
Hold the steak in one hand , and show a live <unk> to it with the other ; that done , dish it ; d ’ ye hear ?
And now to-morrow , cook , when we are cutting in the fish , be sure you stand by to get the <unk> of his fins ; have them put in pickle .
As for the ends of the flukes , have them <unk> , cook .
There , now ye may go . ” But Fleece had hardly got three <unk> off , when he was recalled .
“ Cook , give me <unk> for supper to-morrow night in the <unk> .
D ’ ye hear ?
away you sail , then . — Halloa !
stop !
make a bow before you go . — Avast heaving again !
<unk> for breakfast — don ’ t forget . ” “ <unk> , by <unk> !
whale eat him , ’ <unk> of him eat whale .
I ’ m <unk> if he ain ’ t more of shark <unk> <unk> Shark <unk> , ” muttered the old man , <unk> away ; with which <unk> <unk> he went to his hammock .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Whale as a <unk> .
That mortal man should <unk> upon the creature that feeds his lamp , and , like Stubb , eat him by his own light , as you may say ; this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it .
It is upon record , that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale was <unk> a great delicacy in France , and commanded large <unk> there .
<unk> , that in <unk> <unk> ’ s time , a certain cook of the <unk> obtained a <unk> reward for <unk> an admirable <unk> to be <unk> with <unk> porpoises , which , you remember , are a species of whale .
<unk> , indeed , are to this day considered fine eating .
The meat is made into <unk> about the size of <unk> <unk> , and being well <unk> and <unk> might be taken for <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
The old <unk> of <unk> were very fond of them .
They had a great porpoise <unk> from the crown .
The fact is , that among his hunters at least , the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish , were there not so much of him ; but when you come to sit down before a <unk> nearly one hundred feet long , it takes away your <unk> .
Only the most <unk> of men like Stubb , nowadays <unk> of cooked whales ; but the <unk> are not so <unk> .
We all know how they live upon whales , and have rare old <unk> of prime old train oil .
<unk> , one of their most famous doctors , <unk> <unk> of blubber for infants , as being exceedingly <unk> and <unk> .
And this <unk> me that certain <unk> , who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel — that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy <unk> of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber .
Among the Dutch whalemen these <unk> are called “ <unk> ” ; which , indeed , they greatly <unk> , being brown and <unk> , and <unk> something like old <unk> <unk> ’ <unk> or <unk> , when fresh .
They have such an <unk> look that the most <unk> stranger can hardly keep his hands off .
But what further <unk> the whale as a civilized dish , is his exceeding <unk> .
He is the great <unk> ox of the sea , too fat to be <unk> good .
Look at his hump , which would be as fine eating as the buffalo ’ s ( which is <unk> a rare dish ) , were it not such a solid pyramid of fat .
But the spermaceti itself , how <unk> and creamy that is ; like the transparent , <unk> , white meat of a <unk> in the third month of its <unk> , yet far too rich to supply a <unk> for butter .
Nevertheless , many whalemen have a method of <unk> it into some other substance , and then <unk> of it .
In the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their <unk> into the huge <unk> and let them <unk> there awhile .
Many a good supper have I thus made .
In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish .
The <unk> of the skull is broken into with an axe , and the two <unk> , <unk> <unk> being withdrawn ( precisely resembling two large <unk> ) , they are then mixed with <unk> , and cooked into a most <unk> <unk> , in flavor somewhat resembling calves ’ head , which is quite a dish among some <unk> ; and every one knows that some young <unk> among the <unk> , by continually <unk> upon calves ’ brains , by and by get to have a little brains of their own , so as to be able to tell a <unk> ’ s head from their own heads ; which , indeed , requires uncommon <unk> .
And that is the reason why a young <unk> with an intelligent looking <unk> ’ s head before him , is somehow one of the <unk> sights you can see .
The head looks a sort of <unk> at him , with an “ <unk> <unk> <unk> ! ” expression .
It is not , perhaps , entirely because the whale is so <unk> unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with <unk> ; that appears to result , in some way , from the consideration before mentioned : _ <unk> _ that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea , and eat it too by its own light .
But no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer ; perhaps he was hung ; and if he had been put on his <unk> by <unk> , he certainly would have been ; and he certainly <unk> it if any murderer does .
Go to the <unk> of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live <unk> staring up at the long rows of dead <unk> .
Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal ’ s jaw ?
<unk> ?
who is not a cannibal ?
I tell you it will be more tolerable for the <unk> that salted down a lean <unk> in his <unk> against a coming <unk> ; it will be more tolerable for that <unk> <unk> , I say , in the day of judgment , than for thee , civilized and enlightened <unk> , who <unk> <unk> to the ground and <unk> on their <unk> <unk> in thy <unk> .
But Stubb , he <unk> the whale by its own light , does he ?
and that is <unk> insult to <unk> , is it ?
Look at your <unk> , there , my civilized and enlightened <unk> <unk> off that <unk> beef , what is that handle made of ? — what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating ?
And what do you pick your teeth with , after <unk> that fat <unk> ?
With a <unk> of the same fowl .
And with what <unk> did the <unk> of the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> his <unk> ?
It is only within the last month or two that that society passed a <unk> to <unk> nothing but steel <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Shark <unk> .
When in the Southern Fishery , a captured Sperm Whale , after long and weary toil , is brought alongside late at night , it is not , as a general thing at least , customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in .
For that business is an exceedingly <unk> one ; is not very soon completed ; and requires all hands to set about it .
Therefore , the common usage is to take in all sail ; lash the helm a ’ lee ; and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight , with the <unk> that , until that time , <unk> shall be kept ; that is , two and two for an hour , each couple , the crew in <unk> shall mount the deck to see that all goes well .
But sometimes , especially upon the Line in the Pacific , this plan will not answer at all ; because such <unk> <unk> of sharks <unk> round the moored carcase , that were he left so for six hours , say , on a stretch , little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning .
In most other parts of the ocean , however , where these fish do not so largely <unk> , their wondrous <unk> can be at times considerably diminished , by vigorously <unk> them up with sharp <unk> , a procedure notwithstanding , which , in some instances , only seems to <unk> them into still greater activity .
But it was not thus in the present case with the Pequod ’ s sharks ; though , to be sure , any man <unk> to such sights , to have looked over her side that night , would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese , and those sharks the <unk> in it .
Nevertheless , upon Stubb setting the <unk> after his supper was concluded ; and when , accordingly , Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on deck , no small excitement was created among the sharks ; for immediately <unk> the cutting <unk> over the side , and lowering three lanterns , so that they cast long gleams of light over the <unk> sea , these two mariners , darting their long <unk> , kept up an incessant <unk> of the sharks , * by striking the keen steel deep into their skulls , seemingly their only vital part .
But in the <unk> <unk> of their mixed and struggling <unk> , the <unk> could not always hit their mark ; and this brought about new <unk> of the incredible ferocity of the foe .
They <unk> snapped , not only at each other ’ s <unk> , but like <unk> bows , bent round , and bit their own ; till those <unk> seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth , to be <unk> <unk> by the <unk> wound .
Nor was this all .
It was <unk> to <unk> with the <unk> and ghosts of these creatures .
A sort of generic or <unk> vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones , after what might be called the individual life had departed .
<unk> and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin , one of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg ’ s hand off , when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw .
* The <unk> used for <unk> is made of the very best steel ; is about the <unk> of a man ’ s spread hand ; and in general shape , <unk> to the garden <unk> after which it is named ; only its sides are perfectly flat , and its upper end considerably <unk> than the lower .
This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible ; and when being used is occasionally <unk> , just like a <unk> .
In its socket , a stiff pole , from twenty to thirty feet long , is inserted for a handle .
“ Queequeg no care what god made him shark , ” said the savage , <unk> lifting his hand up and down ; “ <unk> <unk> god or Nantucket god ; but de god <unk> made shark must be one dam <unk> . ” CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> In .
It was a Saturday night , and such a Sabbath as followed !
<unk> <unk> <unk> of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen .
The ivory Pequod was turned into what seemed a <unk> ; every sailor a <unk> .
You would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red <unk> to the sea gods .
In the first place , the enormous cutting tackles , among other ponderous things comprising a <unk> of blocks generally painted green , and which no single man can possibly lift — this vast bunch of <unk> was swayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head , the strongest point anywhere above a ship ’ s deck .
The end of the <unk> rope winding through these <unk> , was then <unk> to the windlass , and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale ; to this block the great blubber hook , <unk> some one hundred <unk> , was attached .
And now suspended in <unk> over the side , Starbuck and Stubb , the mates , armed with their long spades , began cutting a hole in the body for the <unk> of the hook just above the nearest of the two <unk> .
This done , a broad , <unk> line is cut round the hole , the hook is inserted , and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus , now <unk> heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass .
When instantly , the entire ship <unk> over on her side ; every bolt in her <unk> like the <unk> of an old house in frosty weather ; she <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> her <unk> mast-heads to the sky .
More and more she <unk> over to the whale , while every <unk> heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows ; till at last , a swift , <unk> snap is heard ; with a great <unk> the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale , and the <unk> tackle rises into sight dragging after it the <unk> <unk> end of the first strip of blubber .
Now as the blubber <unk> the whale precisely as the <unk> does an <unk> , so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an <unk> is sometimes stripped by <unk> it .
For the strain <unk> kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water , and as the blubber in one strip <unk> <unk> off along the line called the “ <unk> , ” simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb , the mates ; and just as fast as it is thus <unk> off , and indeed by that very act itself , it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end <unk> the main-top ; the men at the windlass then <unk> heaving , and for a moment or two the prodigious <unk> mass <unk> to and fro as if let down from the sky , and every one present must take good heed to <unk> it when it swings , else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard .
One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long , keen weapon called a <unk> , and watching his chance he <unk> <unk> out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass .
<unk> this hole , the end of the second <unk> great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber , in order to <unk> for what follows .
<unk> , this accomplished <unk> , warning all hands to stand off , once more makes a scientific dash at the mass , and with a few sidelong , desperate , <unk> <unk> , <unk> it completely in twain ; so that while the short lower part is still fast , the long upper strip , called a <unk> , swings clear , and is all ready for lowering .
The <unk> forward now <unk> their song , and while the one tackle is <unk> and hoisting a second strip from the whale , the other is slowly slackened away , and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath , into an <unk> parlor called the <unk> .
<unk> this twilight apartment <unk> <unk> hands keep coiling away the long <unk> as if it were a great live mass of <unk> <unk> .
And thus the work proceeds ; the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously ; both whale and windlass heaving , the <unk> singing , the <unk> gentlemen coiling , the mates <unk> , the ship straining , and all hands swearing occasionally , by way of <unk> the general <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
I have given no small attention to that not <unk> subject , the skin of the whale .
I have had <unk> about it with experienced whalemen afloat , and learned naturalists ashore .
My original opinion remains <unk> ; but it is only an opinion .
The question is , what and where is the skin of the whale ?
Already you know what his blubber is .
That blubber is something of the <unk> of firm , <unk> beef , but <unk> , more elastic and <unk> , and <unk> from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness .
Now , however <unk> it may at first seem to talk of any creature ’ s skin as being of that sort of <unk> and thickness , yet in point of fact these are no <unk> against such a <unk> ; because you cannot raise any other dense <unk> layer from the whale ’ s body but that same blubber ; and the <unk> <unk> layer of any animal , if <unk> dense , what can that be but the skin ?
True , from the <unk> dead body of the whale , you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin , transparent substance , somewhat resembling the <unk> shreds of <unk> , only it is almost as <unk> and soft as <unk> ; that is , previous to being dried , when it not only <unk> and <unk> , but becomes rather hard and <unk> .
I have several such dried bits , which I use for marks in my <unk> .
It is transparent , as I said before ; and being laid upon the <unk> page , I have sometimes pleased myself with <unk> it <unk> a <unk> influence .
At any rate , it is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles , as you may say .
But what I am driving at here is this .
That same infinitely thin , <unk> substance , which , I admit , invests the entire body of the whale , is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature , as the skin of the skin , so to speak ; for it were simply ridiculous to say , that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is <unk> and more tender than the skin of a <unk> child .
But no more of this .
<unk> the blubber to be the skin of the whale ; then , when this skin , as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale , will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil ; and , when it is considered that , in quantity , or rather weight , that oil , in its expressed state , is only three <unk> , and not the entire substance of the coat ; some idea may hence be had of the <unk> of that animated mass , a mere part of whose mere <unk> <unk> such a lake of <unk> as that .
<unk> ten barrels to the <unk> , you have ten tons for the <unk> weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale ’ s skin .
In life , the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents .
Almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and <unk> with numberless straight marks in thick array , something like those in the finest <unk> line engravings .
But these marks do not seem to be <unk> upon the <unk> substance above mentioned , but seem to be seen through it , as if they were <unk> upon the body itself .
Nor is this all .
In some instances , to the quick , <unk> eye , those <unk> marks , as in a veritable <unk> , but afford the ground for far other <unk> .
These are <unk> ; that is , if you call those mysterious <unk> on the walls of <unk> hieroglyphics , then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion .
By my <unk> memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular , I was much struck with a plate representing the old Indian <unk> <unk> on the famous <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
Like those mystic rocks , too , the <unk> whale remains <unk> .
This allusion to the Indian rocks <unk> me of another thing .
Besides all the other <unk> which the <unk> of the Sperm Whale presents , he not seldom <unk> the back , and more especially his flanks , <unk> in great part of the regular <unk> appearance , by reason of numerous rude <unk> , altogether of an irregular , random aspect .
I should say that those New England rocks on the <unk> , which <unk> <unk> to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating <unk> — I should say , that those rocks must not a little <unk> the Sperm Whale in this particular .
It also seems to me that such <unk> in the whale are probably made by <unk> contact with other whales ; for I have most <unk> them in the large , full-grown <unk> of the species .
A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale .
It has already been said , that it is <unk> from him in long pieces , called <unk> .
Like most <unk> , this one is very happy and significant .
For the whale is indeed <unk> up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane ; or , still better , an Indian <unk> <unk> over his head , and <unk> his extremity .
It is by reason of this cosy <unk> of his body , that the whale is <unk> to keep himself comfortable in all <unk> , in all seas , times , and tides .
What would become of a Greenland whale , say , in those shuddering , icy seas of the North , if <unk> with his cosy <unk> ?
True , other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those <unk> waters ; but these , be it observed , are your <unk> , <unk> fish , whose very bellies are <unk> ; creatures , that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg , as a traveller in winter would <unk> before an inn fire ; whereas , like man , the whale has lungs and warm blood .
<unk> his blood , and he dies .
How wonderful is it then — except after <unk> — that this great monster , to whom corporeal <unk> is as indispensable as it is to man ; how wonderful that he should be found at home , <unk> to his lips for life in those Arctic waters !
where , when seamen fall overboard , they are sometimes found , months afterwards , perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice , as a fly is found <unk> in amber .
But more surprising is it to know , as has been proved by experiment , that the blood of a Polar whale is <unk> than that of a <unk> negro in summer .
It does seem to me , that <unk> we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality , and the rare virtue of thick walls , and the rare virtue of interior <unk> .
Oh , man !
<unk> and model thyself after the whale !
Do thou , too , remain warm among ice .
Do thou , too , live in this world without being of it .
Be cool at the equator ; keep thy blood fluid at the <unk> .
Like the great <unk> of St. Peter ’ s , and like the great whale , retain , O man !
in all seasons a <unk> of thine own .
But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things !
Of <unk> , how few are <unk> like St. Peter ’ s !
of creatures , how few vast as the whale !
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
“ Haul in the chains !
Let the carcase go astern ! ” The vast tackles have now done their duty .
The <unk> white body of the beheaded whale flashes like a marble <unk> ; though changed in hue , it has not <unk> lost anything in bulk .
It is still colossal .
<unk> it floats more and more away , the water round it torn and <unk> by the <unk> sharks , and the air above <unk> with <unk> <unk> of screaming fowls , whose <unk> are like so many <unk> <unk> in the whale .
The vast white <unk> phantom floats further and further from the ship , and every rod that it so floats , what seem square <unk> of sharks and <unk> <unk> of fowls , augment the murderous din .
For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen .
<unk> the <unk> and mild azure sky , upon the fair face of the pleasant sea , <unk> by the <unk> breezes , that great mass of death floats on and on , till lost in infinite <unk> .
There ’ s a most <unk> and most <unk> funeral !
The <unk> all in pious <unk> , the <unk> all <unk> in black or <unk> .
In life but few of them would have helped the whale , I <unk> , if <unk> he had needed it ; but upon the banquet of his funeral they most <unk> do <unk> .
Oh , horrible <unk> of earth !
from which not the mightiest whale is free .
Nor is this the end .
<unk> as the body is , a vengeful ghost <unk> and <unk> over it to <unk> .
<unk> by some timid <unk> or <unk> <unk> from afar , when the distance <unk> the <unk> fowls , nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun , and the white spray heaving high against it ; straightway the whale ’ s <unk> corpse , with trembling fingers is set down in the log — _ shoals , rocks , and breakers hereabouts : beware ! _ And for years afterwards , perhaps , ships <unk> the place ; leaping over it as silly <unk> leap over a <unk> , because their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held .
There ’ s your law of <unk> ; there ’ s your <unk> of traditions ; there ’ s the story of your <unk> <unk> of old <unk> never <unk> on the earth , and now not even hovering in the air !
There ’ s <unk> !
Thus , while in life the great whale ’ s body may have been a real terror to his foes , in his death his ghost becomes a <unk> panic to a world .
Are you a <unk> in ghosts , my friend ?
There are other ghosts than the <unk> one , and far deeper men than <unk> Johnson who believe in them .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
It should not have been omitted that previous to completely <unk> the body of the leviathan , he was beheaded .
Now , the <unk> of the Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat , upon which experienced whale <unk> very much pride themselves : and not without reason .
Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck ; on the contrary , where his head and body seem to join , there , in that very place , is the <unk> part of him .
<unk> , also , that the surgeon must <unk> from above , some eight or ten feet <unk> between him and his subject , and that subject almost hidden in a <unk> , rolling , and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea .
Bear in mind , too , that under these <unk> circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh ; and in that <unk> manner , without so much as getting one single peep into the <unk> <unk> thus made , he must <unk> steer clear of all <unk> , <unk> parts , and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its <unk> into the skull .
Do you not <unk> , then , at Stubb ’ s <unk> , that he demanded but ten minutes to <unk> a sperm whale ?
When first <unk> , the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped .
That done , if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately <unk> of .
But , with a full grown leviathan this is impossible ; for the sperm whale ’ s head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk , and completely to <unk> such a burden as that , even by the immense tackles of a whaler , this were as vain a thing as to attempt <unk> a Dutch <unk> in <unk> ’ scales .
The Pequod ’ s whale being <unk> and the body stripped , the head was hoisted against the ship ’ s side — about half way out of the sea , so that it might yet in great part be <unk> up by its native element .
And there with the strained craft <unk> leaning over to it , by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head , and every <unk> on that side projecting like a <unk> over the waves ; there , that <unk> head hung to the Pequod ’ s waist like the <unk> <unk> ’ s from the <unk> of <unk> .
When this last task was accomplished it was noon , and the seamen went below to their dinner .
<unk> reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck .
An intense copper calm , like a universal yellow <unk> , was more and more <unk> its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea .
A short space elapsed , and up into this <unk> came Ahab alone from his cabin .
<unk> a few turns on the quarter-deck , he paused to gaze over the side , then slowly getting into the <unk> he took Stubb ’ s long spade — still remaining there after the whale ’ s <unk> — and striking it into the lower part of the <unk> mass , placed its other end <unk> under one arm , and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head .
It was a black and hooded head ; and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm , it seemed the <unk> ’ s in the desert .
“ <unk> , thou vast and venerable head , ” muttered Ahab , “ which , though <unk> with a beard , yet here and there <unk> <unk> with <unk> ; speak , mighty head , and tell us the secret thing that is in thee .
Of all divers , thou hast dived the deepest .
That head upon which the upper sun now gleams , has moved amid this world ’ s foundations .
Where unrecorded names and navies rust , and <unk> <unk> and anchors <unk> ; where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is <unk> with bones of millions of the drowned ; there , in that awful <unk> , there was thy most familiar home .
Thou hast been where bell or <unk> never went ; hast slept by many a sailor ’ s side , where <unk> mothers would give their lives to lay them down .
Thou saw ’ st the locked <unk> when leaping from their flaming ship ; heart to heart they sank beneath the <unk> wave ; true to each other , when heaven seemed false to them .
Thou saw ’ st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck ; for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the <unk> <unk> ; and his murderers still sailed on unharmed — while swift <unk> shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a <unk> <unk> to <unk> , <unk> arms .
O head !
thou hast seen enough to split the <unk> and make an infidel of <unk> , and not one <unk> is thine ! ” “ Sail ho ! ” cried a <unk> voice from the <unk> .
“ Aye ?
Well , now , that ’ s cheering , ” cried Ahab , suddenly <unk> himself , while whole <unk> swept aside from his brow .
“ That lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost <unk> a better man . — Where away ? ” “ Three points on the starboard bow , sir , and bringing down her breeze to us !
“ <unk> and better , man .
Would now St. Paul would come along that way , and to my <unk> bring his breeze !
O Nature , and O soul of man !
how far beyond all <unk> are your linked <unk> !
not the smallest <unk> <unk> or lives on matter , but has its cunning <unk> in mind . ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The Jeroboam ’ s Story .
Hand in hand , ship and breeze blew on ; but the breeze came <unk> than the ship , and soon the Pequod began to rock .
By and by , through the glass the stranger ’ s boats and manned mast-heads proved her a whale-ship .
But as she was so far to windward , and shooting by , apparently making a passage to some other ground , the Pequod could not hope to reach her .
So the signal was set to see what <unk> would be made .
Here be it said , that like the vessels of military <unk> , the ships of the American Whale <unk> have each a private signal ; all which <unk> being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached , every captain is provided with it .
<unk> , the whale <unk> are <unk> to <unk> each other upon the ocean , even at considerable <unk> and with no small <unk> .
The Pequod ’ s signal was at last <unk> to by the stranger ’ s setting her own ; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket .
<unk> her yards , she bore down , ranged <unk> under the Pequod ’ s lee , and lowered a boat ; it soon drew nigh ; but , as the <unk> was being rigged by Starbuck ’ s order to <unk> the <unk> captain , the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat ’ s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary .
It turned out that the Jeroboam had a <unk> <unk> on board , and that Mayhew , her captain , was fearful of <unk> the Pequod ’ s company .
For , though himself and boat ’ s crew remained <unk> , and though his ship was half a <unk> off , and an <unk> sea and air rolling and <unk> between ; yet <unk> adhering to the timid <unk> of the land , he <unk> <unk> to come into direct contact with the Pequod .
But this did by no means prevent all <unk> .
<unk> an interval of some few yards between itself and the ship , the Jeroboam ’ s boat by the occasional use of its oars <unk> to keep parallel to the Pequod , as she heavily forged through the sea ( for by this time it blew very fresh ) , with her <unk> <unk> ; though , indeed , at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave , the boat would be pushed some way ahead ; but would be soon <unk> brought to her proper <unk> again .
<unk> to this , and other the like <unk> now and then , a <unk> was <unk> between the two parties ; but at intervals not without still another <unk> of a very different sort .
<unk> an oar in the Jeroboam ’ s boat , was a man of a singular appearance , even in that wild whaling life where individual <unk> make up all <unk> .
He was a small , short , <unk> man , <unk> all over his face with <unk> , and wearing <unk> yellow hair .
A <unk> , <unk> coat of a faded <unk> <unk> <unk> him ; the <unk> sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists .
A deep , settled , <unk> delirium was in his eyes .
So soon as this figure had been first descried , Stubb had exclaimed — “ That ’ s he !
that ’ s he ! — the <unk> <unk> the Town-Ho ’ s company told us of ! ” Stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the Jeroboam , and a certain man among her crew , some time previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho .
According to this account and what was <unk> learned , it seemed that the <unk> in question had gained a wonderful <unk> over almost everybody in the Jeroboam .
His story was this : He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of <unk> <unk> , where he had been a great prophet ; in their cracked , secret <unk> having several times descended from heaven by the way of a <unk> , announcing the speedy opening of the <unk> vial , which he carried in his <unk> ; but , which , instead of containing <unk> , was supposed to be <unk> with <unk> .
A strange , <unk> <unk> having seized him , he had left <unk> for Nantucket , where , with that cunning peculiar to <unk> , he <unk> a steady , <unk> <unk> , and offered himself as a <unk> <unk> for the Jeroboam ’ s whaling voyage .
They engaged him ; but straightway upon the ship ’ s getting out of sight of land , his insanity broke out in a <unk> .
He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel , and commanded the captain to jump overboard .
He published his <unk> , whereby he set himself forth as the <unk> of the isles of the sea and <unk> of all <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> with which he declared these things ; — the dark , daring play of his <unk> , excited imagination , and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium , united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the <unk> of the ignorant crew , with an atmosphere of <unk> .
Moreover , they were afraid of him .
As such a man , however , was not of much practical use in the ship , especially as he <unk> to work except when he pleased , the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him ; but <unk> that that individual ’ s intention was to land him in the first convenient port , the archangel <unk> opened all his seals and <unk> — <unk> the ship and all hands to unconditional <unk> , in case this intention was carried out .
So strongly did he work upon his <unk> among the crew , that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship , not a man of them would remain .
He was therefore forced to <unk> his plan .
Nor would they <unk> Gabriel to be any way <unk> , say or do what he would ; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete <unk> of the ship .
The consequence of all this was , that the archangel <unk> little or nothing for the captain and mates ; and since the <unk> had broken out , he carried a higher hand than ever ; <unk> that the plague , as he called it , was at his sole command ; nor should it be stayed but according to his good <unk> .
The sailors , mostly poor devils , <unk> , and some of them <unk> before him ; in obedience to his <unk> , sometimes <unk> him personal homage , as to a god .
Such things may seem incredible ; but , however wondrous , they are true .
Nor is the history of <unk> half so striking in respect to the measureless <unk> of the <unk> himself , as his measureless power of <unk> and <unk> so many others .
But it is time to return to the Pequod .
“ I fear not thy <unk> , man , ” said Ahab from the bulwarks , to Captain Mayhew , who stood in the boat ’ s stern ; “ come on board . ” But now Gabriel started to his feet .
“ Think , think of the <unk> , yellow and <unk> !
Beware of the horrible plague ! ” “ Gabriel !
Gabriel ! ” cried Captain Mayhew ; “ thou must either — ” But that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead , and its <unk> drowned all <unk> .
“ Hast thou seen the White Whale ? ” demanded Ahab , when the boat <unk> back .
“ Think , think of thy whale-boat , <unk> and sunk !
Beware of the horrible tail ! ” “ I tell thee again , Gabriel , that — ” But again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends .
Nothing was said for some moments , while a succession of <unk> waves rolled by , which by one of those occasional <unk> of the seas were <unk> , not heaving it .
Meantime , the hoisted sperm whale ’ s head <unk> about very violently , and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to <unk> .
When this interlude was over , Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning Moby Dick ; not , however , without <unk> <unk> from Gabriel , whenever his name was mentioned , and the crazy sea that seemed <unk> with him .
It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home , when upon speaking a whale-ship , her people were <unk> <unk> of the existence of Moby Dick , and the <unk> he had made .
<unk> sucking in this intelligence , Gabriel solemnly <unk> the captain against <unk> the White Whale , in case the monster should be seen ; in his <unk> insanity , <unk> the White Whale to be no less a being than the <unk> God <unk> ; the <unk> receiving the Bible .
But when , some year or two afterwards , Moby Dick was fairly <unk> from the mast-heads , Macey , the chief mate , burned with <unk> to encounter him ; and the captain himself being not <unk> to let him have the opportunity , <unk> all the archangel ’ s <unk> and <unk> , Macey succeeded in <unk> five men to man his boat .
With them he pushed off ; and , after much weary pulling , and many perilous , <unk> <unk> , he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast .
Meantime , Gabriel , ascending to the <unk> mast-head , was tossing one arm in frantic gestures , and <unk> forth <unk> of speedy doom to the <unk> <unk> of his <unk> .
Now , while Macey , the mate , was standing up in his boat ’ s bow , and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was <unk> his wild <unk> upon the whale , and <unk> to get a fair chance for his <unk> lance , lo !
a broad white shadow rose from the sea ; by its quick , <unk> motion , temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen .
Next instant , the <unk> mate , so full of furious life , was smitten bodily into the air , and making a long <unk> in his <unk> , fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards .
Not a chip of the boat was <unk> , nor a hair of any oarsman ’ s head ; but the mate for ever sank .
It is well to <unk> here , that of the fatal accidents in the <unk> Fishery , this kind is perhaps almost as <unk> as any .
Sometimes , nothing is <unk> but the man who is thus <unk> ; oftener the boat ’ s bow is knocked off , or the <unk> , in which the headsman stands , is torn from its place and <unk> the body .
But <unk> of all is the circumstance , that in more instances than one , when the body has been recovered , not a single mark of violence is discernible ; the man being stark dead .
The whole <unk> , with the falling form of Macey , was plainly descried from the ship .
<unk> a piercing <unk> — “ The vial !
the vial ! ” Gabriel called off the <unk> crew from the further hunting of the whale .
This terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence ; because his credulous <unk> believed that he had <unk> <unk> it , instead of only making a general prophecy , which any one might have done , and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed .
He became a nameless terror to the ship .
Mayhew having concluded his <unk> , Ahab put such questions to him , that the stranger captain could not <unk> inquiring whether he intended to hunt the White Whale , if opportunity should offer .
To which Ahab answered — “ Aye . ” <unk> , then , Gabriel once more started to his feet , <unk> upon the old man , and <unk> exclaimed , with downward pointed finger — “ Think , think of the <unk> — dead , and down there ! — beware of the <unk> ’ s end ! ” Ahab <unk> turned aside ; then said to Mayhew , “ Captain , I have just <unk> me of my <unk> ; there is a letter for one of thy officers , if I mistake not .
Starbuck , look over the bag . ” Every whale-ship takes out a <unk> number of letters for various ships , whose <unk> to the persons to whom they may be addressed , depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans .
Thus , most letters never reach their mark ; and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three years or more .
Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand .
It was <unk> tumbled , damp , and covered with a dull , <unk> , green mould , in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin .
Of such a letter , Death himself might well have been the <unk> .
“ Can ’ st not read it ? ” cried Ahab .
“ Give it me , man .
Aye , aye , it ’ s but a dim <unk> ; — what ’ s this ? ” As he was studying it out , Starbuck took a long cutting-spade pole , and with his knife slightly split the end , to <unk> the letter there , and in that way , hand it to the boat , without its coming any closer to the ship .
Meantime , Ahab holding the letter , muttered , “ Mr.
<unk> — yes , Mr. <unk> — ( a woman ’ s <unk> hand , — the man ’ s wife , I ’ ll <unk> ) — Aye — Mr.
<unk> Macey , Ship Jeroboam ; — why it ’ s Macey , and he ’ s dead ! ” “ Poor fellow !
poor fellow !
and from his wife , ” <unk> Mayhew ; “ but let me have it . ” “ Nay , keep it thyself , ” cried Gabriel to Ahab ; “ thou art soon going that way . ” “ <unk> <unk> thee ! ” yelled Ahab .
“ Captain Mayhew , stand by now to receive it ” ; and taking the fatal <unk> from Starbuck ’ s hands , he caught it in the <unk> of the pole , and reached it over towards the boat .
But as he did so , the oarsmen <unk> <unk> from rowing ; the boat <unk> a little towards the ship ’ s stern ; so that , as if by magic , the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel ’ s eager hand .
He <unk> it in an instant , seized the <unk> , and <unk> the letter on it , sent it thus loaded back into the ship .
It fell at Ahab ’ s feet .
Then Gabriel <unk> out to his comrades to give way with their oars , and in that manner the <unk> boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod .
As , after this interlude , the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale , many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
In the tumultuous business of <unk> and attending to a whale , there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew .
Now hands are wanted here , and then again hands are wanted there .
There is no <unk> in any one place ; for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere .
It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene .
We must now <unk> our way a little .
It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale ’ s back , the <unk> was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates .
But how did so clumsy and <unk> a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole ?
It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg , whose duty it was , as harpooneer , to descend upon the monster ’ s back for the special purpose <unk> to .
But in very many cases , circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole <unk> or <unk> operation is concluded .
The whale , be it observed , lies almost entirely submerged , <unk> the immediate parts operated upon .
So down there , some ten feet below the level of the deck , the poor harpooneer <unk> about , half on the whale and half in the water , as the vast mass <unk> like a <unk> beneath him .
On the occasion in question , Queequeg <unk> in the <unk> <unk> — a shirt and socks — in which to my eyes , at least , he appeared to uncommon advantage ; and no one had a better chance to observe him , as will presently be seen .
Being the savage ’ s bowsman , that is , the person who pulled the <unk> in his boat ( the second one from forward ) , it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that <unk> <unk> upon the dead whale ’ s back .
You have seen <unk> <unk> holding a <unk> by a long cord .
Just so , from the ship ’ s steep side , did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea , by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope , attached to a strong strip of canvas <unk> round his waist .
It was a humorously perilous business for both of us .
For , before we proceed further , it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both ends ; fast to Queequeg ’ s broad canvas belt , and fast to my narrow leather one .
So that for better or for worse , we two , for the time , were wedded ; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more , then both usage and honor demanded , that instead of cutting the cord , it should drag me down in his wake .
So , then , an <unk> <unk> <unk> united us .
Queequeg was my own <unk> <unk> brother ; nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous <unk> which the hempen <unk> <unk> .
So strongly and <unk> did I <unk> of my situation then , that while earnestly watching his motions , I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own <unk> was now <unk> in a <unk> stock company of two ; that my free will had received a mortal wound ; and that another ’ s mistake or <unk> might <unk> innocent me into <unk> <unk> and death .
Therefore , I saw that here was a sort of <unk> in <unk> ; for its <unk> <unk> never could have so <unk> an <unk> .
And yet still further pondering — while I <unk> him now and then from between the whale and ship , which would <unk> to <unk> him — still further pondering , I say , I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes ; only , in most cases , he , one way or other , has this <unk> connexion with a <unk> of other mortals .
If your <unk> breaks , you snap ; if your <unk> by mistake <unk> you poison in your <unk> , you die .
True , you may say that , by exceeding <unk> , you may possibly escape these and the <unk> other evil chances of life .
But handle Queequeg ’ s monkey-rope <unk> as I would , sometimes he <unk> it so , that I came very near sliding overboard .
Nor could I possibly forget that , do what I would , I only had the management of one end of it .
* * The monkey-rope is found in all whalers ; but it was only in the Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together .
This <unk> upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb , in order to afford the <unk> harpooneer the strongest possible <unk> for the <unk> and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder .
I have hinted that I would often <unk> poor Queequeg from between the whale and the ship — where he would occasionally fall , from the incessant rolling and swaying of both .
But this was not the only <unk> jeopardy he was exposed to .
<unk> by the <unk> made upon them during the night , the sharks now <unk> and more <unk> <unk> by the before <unk> blood which began to flow from the <unk> — the <unk> creatures <unk> round it like <unk> in a <unk> .
And right in among those sharks was Queequeg ; who often pushed them aside with his <unk> feet .
A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale , the otherwise <unk> <unk> shark will seldom touch a man .
Nevertheless , it may well be believed that since they have such a <unk> finger in the <unk> , it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them .
<unk> , besides the monkey-rope , with which I now and then <unk> the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the <unk> of what seemed a peculiarly <unk> shark — he was provided with still another <unk> .
<unk> over the side in one of the <unk> , Tashtego and Daggoo continually <unk> over his head a couple of keen <unk> , <unk> they <unk> as many sharks as they could reach .
This procedure of theirs , to be sure , was very <unk> and benevolent of them .
They meant Queequeg ’ s best <unk> , I admit ; but in their <unk> <unk> to <unk> him , and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the <unk> water , those <unk> spades of theirs would come nearer <unk> a leg than a tail .
But poor Queequeg , I suppose , straining and <unk> there with that great iron hook — poor Queequeg , I suppose , only <unk> to his Yojo , and gave up his life into the hands of his gods .
Well , well , my dear comrade and <unk> , thought I , as I drew in and then <unk> off the rope to every swell of the sea — what matters it , after all ?
Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world ?
That <unk> ocean you <unk> in , is Life ; those sharks , your foes ; those spades , your friends ; and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril , poor lad .
But courage !
there is good cheer in store for you , Queequeg .
For now , as with blue lips and <unk> eyes the exhausted savage at last <unk> up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side ; the steward advances , and with a benevolent , <unk> glance hands him — what ?
Some hot <unk> ?
No !
hands him , ye gods !
hands him a cup of <unk> ginger and water !
“ <unk> ?
Do I smell ginger ? ” <unk> asked Stubb , coming near .
“ Yes , this must be ginger , ” peering into the as yet <unk> cup .
Then standing as if incredulous for a while , he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying , “ <unk> ?
ginger ?
and will you have the goodness to tell me , Mr. Dough-Boy , where lies the virtue of ginger ?
<unk> !
is ginger the sort of fuel you use , <unk> , to <unk> a fire in this shivering cannibal ?
<unk> ! — what the devil is ginger ?
<unk> ?
<unk> ? — <unk> <unk> ? — <unk> ? — <unk> ? — what the devil is ginger , I say , that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here . ” “ There is some <unk> <unk> <unk> movement about this business , ” he suddenly added , now approaching Starbuck , who had just come from forward .
“ Will you look at that <unk> , sir : smell of it , if you please . ” Then watching the mate ’ s countenance , he added , “ The steward , Mr. Starbuck , had the face to offer that <unk> and <unk> to Queequeg , there , this instant off the whale .
Is the steward an <unk> , sir ?
and may I ask whether this is the sort of <unk> by which he blows back the life into a <unk> man ? ” “ I trust not , ” said Starbuck , “ it is poor stuff enough . ” “ Aye , aye , steward , ” cried Stubb , “ we ’ ll teach you to <unk> a harpooneer ; none of your <unk> ’ s <unk> here ; you want to poison us , do ye ?
You have got out <unk> on our lives and want to murder us all , and pocket the proceeds , do ye ? ” “ It was not me , ” cried Dough-Boy , “ it was Aunt Charity that brought the ginger on board ; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits , but only this <unk> — so she called it . ” “ <unk> !
you <unk> rascal !
take that !
and run along with ye to the <unk> , and get something better .
I hope I do no wrong , Mr. Starbuck .
It is the captain ’ s orders — <unk> for the harpooneer on a whale . ” “ <unk> , ” replied Starbuck , “ only don ’ t hit him again , but — ” “ Oh , I never <unk> when I hit , except when I hit a whale or something of that sort ; and this fellow ’ s a <unk> .
What were you about saying , sir ? ” “ Only this : go down with him , and get what thou <unk> thyself . ” When Stubb <unk> , he came with a dark <unk> in one hand , and a sort of <unk> in the other .
The first contained strong spirits , and was <unk> to Queequeg ; the second was Aunt Charity ’ s <unk> , and that was freely given to the waves .
CHAPTER <unk> .
Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale ; and Then Have a Talk over Him .
It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale ’ s prodigious head hanging to the Pequod ’ s side .
But we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it .
For the present other matters <unk> , and the best we can do now for the head , is to pray heaven the tackles may hold .
Now , during the past night and <unk> , the Pequod had gradually <unk> into a sea , which , by its occasional <unk> of yellow brit , gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales , a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near .
And though all hands commonly <unk> the capture of those inferior creatures ; and though the Pequod was not <unk> to cruise for them at all , and though she had passed numbers of them near the <unk> without lowering a boat ; yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded , to the surprise of all , the announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day , if opportunity offered .
Nor was this long wanting .
<unk> spouts were seen to leeward ; and two boats , Stubb ’ s and Flask ’ s , were detached in pursuit .
<unk> further and further away , they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast-head .
But suddenly in the distance , they saw a great <unk> of tumultuous white water , and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast .
An interval passed and the boats were in plain sight , in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale .
So close did the monster come to the hull , that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice ; but suddenly going down in a <unk> , within three rods of the planks , he wholly disappeared from view , as if diving under the keel .
“ <unk> , cut ! ” was the cry from the ship to the boats , which , for one instant , seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel ’ s side .
But having plenty of line yet in the tubs , and the whale not sounding very rapidly , they paid out abundance of rope , and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship .
For a few minutes the <unk> was <unk> critical ; for while they still <unk> out the <unk> line in one direction , and still <unk> their oars in another , the <unk> strain threatened to take them under .
But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain .
And they stuck to it till they did gain it ; when instantly , a swift <unk> was felt running like lightning along the keel , as the strained line , scraping beneath the ship , suddenly rose to view under her bows , <unk> and <unk> ; and so flinging off its <unk> , that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water , while the whale beyond also rose to sight , and once more the boats were free to fly .
But the <unk> whale <unk> his speed , and blindly <unk> his course , went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him , so that they <unk> a complete <unk> .
Meantime , they hauled more and more upon their lines , till close <unk> him on both sides , Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance ; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went , while the <unk> of sharks that had before <unk> round the Sperm Whale ’ s body , rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled , <unk> drinking at every new <unk> , as the eager <unk> did at the new bursting <unk> that poured from the smitten rock .
At last his spout grew thick , and with a <unk> roll and <unk> , he turned upon his back a corpse .
While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes , and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing , some <unk> ensued between them .
“ I wonder what the old man wants with this <unk> of foul <unk> , ” said Stubb , not without some <unk> at the thought of having to do with so <unk> a leviathan .
“ <unk> with it ? ” said Flask , coiling some spare line in the boat ’ s bow , “ did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale ’ s head hoisted on her starboard side , and at the same time a Right Whale ’ s on the larboard ; did you never hear , Stubb , that that ship can never afterwards <unk> ? ” “ Why not ?
“ I don ’ t know , but I heard that <unk> ghost of a Fedallah saying so , and he seems to know all about ships ’ <unk> .
But I sometimes think he ’ ll charm the ship to no good at last .
I don ’ t half like that chap , Stubb .
Did you ever notice how that <unk> of his is a sort of carved into a <unk> ’ s head , Stubb ? ” “ <unk> him !
I never look at him at all ; but if ever I get a chance of a dark night , and he standing hard by the bulwarks , and no one by ; look down there , Flask ” — pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hands — “ Aye , will I !
Flask , I take that Fedallah to be the devil in <unk> .
Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been <unk> away on board ship ?
He ’ s the devil , I say .
The reason why you don ’ t see his tail , is because he <unk> it up out of sight ; he carries it coiled away in his pocket , I guess .
Blast him !
now that I think of it , he ’ s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots . ” “ He sleeps in his boots , don ’ t he ?
He hasn ’ t got any hammock ; but I ’ ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging . ” “ No doubt , and it ’ s because of his cursed tail ; he coils it down , do ye see , in the eye of the rigging . ” “ What ’ s the old man have so much to do with him for ? ” “ <unk> up a <unk> or a <unk> , I suppose . ” “ <unk> ? — about what ? ” “ Why , do ye see , the old man is hard bent after that White Whale , and the devil there is trying to come round him , and get him to <unk> away his silver watch , or his soul , or something of that sort , and then he ’ ll surrender Moby Dick . ” “ <unk> !
Stubb , you are <unk> ; how can Fedallah do that ? ” “ I don ’ t know , Flask , but the devil is a curious chap , and a wicked one , I tell ye .
Why , they say as how he went a sauntering into the old <unk> once , <unk> his tail about devilish easy and <unk> , and inquiring if the old governor was at home .
Well , he was at home , and asked the devil what he wanted .
The devil , <unk> his <unk> , up and says , ‘ I want John . ’ ‘ What for ? ’ says the old governor .
‘ What business is that of yours , ’ says the devil , getting mad , — ‘ I want to use him . ’ ‘ Take him , ’ says the governor — and by the Lord , Flask , if the devil didn ’ t give John the <unk> <unk> before he got through with him , I ’ ll eat this whale in one <unk> .
But look sharp — ain ’ t you all ready there ?
Well , then , pull ahead , and let ’ s get the whale alongside . ” “ I think I remember some such story as you were telling , ” said Flask , when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship , “ but I can ’ t remember where . ” “ Three <unk> ?
<unk> of those three <unk> <unk> ?
Did ye read it there , Flask ?
I guess ye did ? ” “ No : never saw such a book ; heard of it , though .
But now , tell me , Stubb , do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now , was the same you say is now on board the Pequod ? ” “ <unk> I the same man that helped kill this whale ?
<unk> ’ t the devil live for ever ; who ever heard that the devil was dead ?
Did you ever see any <unk> a wearing <unk> for the devil ?
And if the devil has a <unk> to get into the <unk> ’ s cabin , don ’ t you suppose he can crawl into a <unk> ?
Tell me that , Mr. Flask ? ” “ How old do you suppose Fedallah is , Stubb ? ” “ Do you see that mainmast there ? ” pointing to the ship ; “ well , that ’ s the figure one ; now take all the hoops in the Pequod ’ s hold , and string along in a row with that mast , for <unk> , do you see ; well , that wouldn ’ t begin to be Fedallah ’ s age .
Nor all the <unk> in creation couldn ’ t show hoops enough to make <unk> enough . ” “ But see here , Stubb , I thought you a little <unk> just now , that you meant to give Fedallah a <unk> , if you got a good chance .
Now , if he ’ s so old as all those hoops of yours come to , and if he is going to live for ever , what good will it do to pitch him overboard — tell me that ?
“ Give him a good <unk> , <unk> . ” “ But he ’ d crawl back . ” “ <unk> him again ; and keep <unk> him . ” “ <unk> he should take it into his head to <unk> you , though — yes , and drown you — what then ? ” “ I should like to see him try it ; I ’ d give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldn ’ t dare to show his face in the <unk> ’ s cabin again for a long while , let alone down in the <unk> there , where he lives , and hereabouts on the upper decks where he <unk> so much .
Damn the devil , Flask ; so you suppose I ’ m afraid of the devil ?
Who ’ s afraid of him , except the old governor who <unk> ’ t catch him and put him in <unk> , as he <unk> , but <unk> him go about <unk> people ; aye , and signed a <unk> with him , that all the people the devil <unk> , he ’ d <unk> for him ?
There ’ s a governor ! ” “ Do you suppose Fedallah wants to <unk> Captain Ahab ? ” “ Do I suppose it ?
You ’ ll know it before long , Flask .
But I am going now to keep a sharp look-out on him ; and if I see anything very suspicious going on , I ’ ll just take him by the <unk> of his neck , and say — Look here , <unk> , you don ’ t do it ; and if he makes any <unk> , by the Lord I ’ ll make a <unk> into his pocket for his tail , take it to the capstan , and give him such a <unk> and heaving , that his tail will come short off at the stump — do you see ; and then , I rather guess when he finds himself <unk> in that queer fashion , he ’ ll <unk> off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs . ” “ And what will you do with the tail , Stubb ? ” “ Do with it ?
<unk> it for an ox whip when we get home ; — what else ? ” “ Now , do you mean what you say , and have been saying all along , Stubb ? ” “ <unk> or not mean , here we are at the ship . ” The boats were here hailed , to tow the whale on the larboard side , where <unk> chains and other <unk> were already prepared for securing him .
“ Didn ’ t I tell you so ? ” said Flask ; “ yes , you ’ ll soon see this right whale ’ s head hoisted up opposite that <unk> ’ s . ” In good time , Flask ’ s saying proved true .
As before , the Pequod <unk> leaned over towards the sperm whale ’ s head , now , by the <unk> of both heads , she <unk> her even keel ; though <unk> strained , you may well believe .
So , when on one side you hoist in <unk> ’ s head , you go over that way ; but now , on the other side , hoist in <unk> ’ s and you come back again ; but in very poor plight .
Thus , some minds for ever keep <unk> boat .
Oh , ye foolish !
throw all these <unk> overboard , and then you will float light and right .
In <unk> of the body of a right whale , when brought alongside the ship , the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale ; only , in the latter instance , the head is cut off whole , but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck , with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the <unk> .
But nothing like this , in the present case , had been done .
The <unk> of both whales had dropped astern ; and the <unk> ship not a little <unk> a <unk> carrying a pair of <unk> <unk> .
Meantime , Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale ’ s head , and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand .
And Ahab chanced so to stand , that the Parsee occupied his shadow ; while , if the Parsee ’ s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with , and <unk> Ahab ’ s .
As the crew toiled on , <unk> <unk> were <unk> among them , concerning all these passing things .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Sperm Whale ’ s Head — Contrasted View .
Here , now , are two great whales , laying their heads together ; let us join them , and lay together our own .
Of the grand order of <unk> leviathans , the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale are by far the most <unk> .
They are the only whales regularly hunted by man .
To the Nantucketer , they present the two <unk> of all the known varieties of the whale .
As the external difference between them is <unk> <unk> in their heads ; and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod ’ s side ; and as we may freely go from one to the other , by merely stepping across the deck : — where , I should like to know , will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here ?
In the first place , you are struck by the general contrast between these heads .
Both are massive enough in all conscience ; but there is a certain <unk> <unk> in the Sperm Whale ’ s which the Right Whale ’ s sadly <unk> .
There is more character in the Sperm Whale ’ s head .
As you behold it , you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him , in point of <unk> dignity .
In the present instance , too , this dignity is heightened by the <unk> and salt colour of his head at the summit , giving token of advanced age and large experience .
In short , he is what the fishermen technically call a “ <unk> whale . ” Let us now note what is least <unk> in these heads — namely , the two most important <unk> , the eye and the ear .
Far back on the side of the head , and low down , near the angle of either whale ’ s jaw , if you <unk> search , you will at last see a <unk> eye , which you would fancy to be a young colt ’ s eye ; so out of all <unk> is it to the magnitude of the head .
Now , from this peculiar <unk> position of the whale ’ s eyes , it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead , no more than he can one exactly astern .
In a word , the position of the whale ’ s eyes <unk> to that of a man ’ s ears ; and you may fancy , for yourself , how it would fare with you , did you sideways <unk> objects through your ears .
You would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight <unk> of sight ; and about thirty more behind it .
If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you , with <unk> uplifted in broad day , you would not be able to see him , any more than if he were <unk> upon you from behind .
In a word , you would have two backs , so to speak ; but , at the same time , also , two <unk> ( side <unk> ) : for what is it that makes the front of a man — what , indeed , but his eyes ?
Moreover , while in most other animals that I can now think of , the eyes are so planted as <unk> to blend their <unk> power , so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain ; the peculiar position of the whale ’ s eyes , <unk> divided as they are by many <unk> feet of solid head , which <unk> between them like a great mountain <unk> two <unk> in valleys ; this , of course , must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ <unk> .
The whale , therefore , must see one distinct picture on this side , and another distinct picture on that side ; while all between must be profound darkness and <unk> to him .
Man may , in effect , be said to look out on the world from a <unk> with two joined <unk> for his window .
But with the whale , these two <unk> are separately inserted , making two distinct windows , but sadly <unk> the view .
This peculiarity of the whale ’ s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery ; and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes .
A curious and most <unk> question might be started concerning this <unk> matter as touching the Leviathan .
But I must be content with a hint .
So long as a man ’ s eyes are open in the light , the act of seeing is <unk> ; that is , he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him .
Nevertheless , any one ’ s experience will teach him , that though he can take in an <unk> sweep of things at one glance , it is quite impossible for him , attentively , and completely , to <unk> any two things — however large or however small — at one and the same instant of time ; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other .
But if you now come to separate these two objects , and <unk> each by a circle of profound darkness ; then , in order to see one of them , in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it , the other will be utterly <unk> from your <unk> consciousness .
How is it , then , with the whale ?
True , both his eyes , in themselves , must simultaneously act ; but is his brain so much more <unk> , <unk> , and subtle than man ’ s , that he can at the same moment of time attentively <unk> two distinct <unk> , one on one side of him , and the other in an exactly opposite direction ?
If he can , then is it as marvellous a thing in him , as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the <unk> of two distinct <unk> in <unk> .
Nor , strictly <unk> , is there any <unk> in this comparison .
It may be but an <unk> <unk> , but it has always seemed to me , that the extraordinary <unk> of movement <unk> by some whales when <unk> by three or four boats ; the <unk> and <unk> to queer <unk> , so common to such whales ; I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the <unk> <unk> of volition , in which their divided and <unk> opposite powers of vision must involve them .
But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye .
If you are an entire stranger to their race , you might hunt over these two heads for hours , and never discover that organ .
The ear has no external <unk> whatever ; and into the hole itself you can hardly <unk> a <unk> , so <unk> minute is it .
It is lodged a little behind the eye .
With respect to their ears , this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right .
While the ear of the former has an external opening , that of the latter is entirely and <unk> covered over with a <unk> , so as to be quite <unk> from without .
Is it not curious , that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye , and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a <unk> ’ s ?
But if his eyes were broad as the <unk> of <unk> ’ s great <unk> ; and his ears <unk> as the <unk> of <unk> ; would that make him any longer of sight , or <unk> of hearing ?
Not at all . — Why then do you try to “ <unk> ” your mind ?
<unk> it .
Let us now with whatever <unk> and <unk> we have at hand , <unk> over the sperm whale ’ s head , that it may lie bottom up ; then , ascending by a ladder to the summit , have a peep down the mouth ; and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it , with a lantern we might descend into the great <unk> <unk> <unk> of his stomach .
But let us hold on here by this tooth , and look about us where we are .
What a really beautiful and <unk> mouth !
from floor to ceiling , <unk> , or rather <unk> with a glistening white <unk> , <unk> as <unk> <unk> .
But come out now , and look at this portentous lower jaw , which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense <unk> , with the <unk> at one end , instead of one side .
If you pry it up , so as to get it overhead , and expose its rows of teeth , it seems a terrific <unk> ; and such , alas !
it <unk> to many a poor wight in the fishery , upon whom these <unk> fall with <unk> force .
But far more terrible is it to behold , when fathoms down in the sea , you see some <unk> whale , floating there suspended , with his prodigious jaw , some fifteen feet long , hanging straight down at <unk> with his body , for all the world like a ship ’ s <unk> .
This whale is not dead ; he is only <unk> ; out of sorts , perhaps ; <unk> ; and so <unk> , that the <unk> of his jaw have <unk> , leaving him there in that <unk> sort of plight , a <unk> to all his tribe , who must , no doubt , <unk> <unk> upon him .
In most cases this lower jaw — being easily <unk> by a <unk> artist — is <unk> and hoisted on deck for the purpose of <unk> the ivory teeth , and <unk> a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles , including <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> to <unk> .
With a long , weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board , as if it were an anchor ; and when the proper time comes — some few days after the other work — Queequeg , Daggoo , and Tashtego , being all accomplished <unk> , are set to drawing teeth .
With a keen cutting-spade , Queequeg lances the <unk> ; then the jaw is lashed down to <unk> , and a tackle being rigged from aloft , they drag out these teeth , as <unk> <unk> drag <unk> of old <unk> out of wild wood lands .
There are generally <unk> teeth in all ; in old whales , much worn down , but <unk> ; nor filled after our artificial fashion .
The jaw is afterwards <unk> into slabs , and piled away like <unk> for <unk> houses .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Right Whale ’ s Head — Contrasted View .
<unk> the deck , let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale ’ s head .
As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale ’ s head may be compared to a Roman <unk> ( especially in front , where it is so <unk> rounded ) ; so , at a broad view , the Right Whale ’ s head bears a rather <unk> resemblance to a gigantic <unk> <unk> .
Two hundred years ago an old Dutch <unk> likened its shape to that of a <unk> ’ s last .
And in this same last or <unk> , that old woman of the <unk> <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> , might very <unk> be lodged , she and all her <unk> .
But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to <unk> different aspects , according to your point of view .
If you stand on its summit and look at these two <unk> <unk> , you would take the whole head for an enormous <unk> , and these <unk> , the <unk> in its <unk> .
Then , again , if you <unk> your eye upon this strange , <unk> , <unk> <unk> on the top of the mass — this green , <unk> thing , which the <unk> call the “ crown , ” and the Southern <unk> the “ <unk> ” of the Right Whale ; <unk> your eyes solely on this , you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak , with a bird ’ s nest in its crotch .
At any rate , when you watch those live <unk> that <unk> here on this <unk> , such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you ; unless , indeed , your fancy has been fixed by the <unk> term “ crown ” also bestowed upon it ; in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a <unk> king of the sea , whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner .
But if this whale be a king , he is a very <unk> looking fellow to grace a <unk> .
Look at that hanging lower lip !
what a huge <unk> and <unk> is there !
a <unk> and <unk> , by carpenter ’ s <unk> , about twenty feet long and five feet deep ; a <unk> and <unk> that will yield you some <unk> gallons of oil and more .
A great pity , now , that this <unk> whale should be <unk> .
The <unk> is about a foot across .
<unk> the mother during an important interval was sailing down the <unk> coast , when <unk> caused the beach to <unk> .
<unk> this lip , as over a slippery threshold , we now slide into the mouth .
Upon my word were I at <unk> , I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam .
Good Lord !
is this the road that Jonah went ?
The <unk> is about twelve feet high , and runs to a pretty sharp angle , as if there were a regular <unk> there ; while these ribbed , arched , <unk> sides , present us with those wondrous , half vertical , <unk> <unk> of whalebone , say three hundred on a side , which <unk> from the upper part of the head or crown bone , form those <unk> blinds which have elsewhere been <unk> mentioned .
The <unk> of these bones are <unk> with <unk> fibres , through which the Right Whale <unk> the water , and in whose <unk> he <unk> the small fish , when <unk> he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time .
In the central blinds of bone , as they stand in their natural order , there are certain curious marks , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , whereby some whalemen <unk> the creature ’ s age , as the age of an oak by its circular rings .
Though the <unk> of this <unk> is far from <unk> , yet it has the <unk> of <unk> probability .
At any rate , if we yield to it , we must <unk> a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem reasonable .
In old times , there seem to have <unk> the most curious <unk> concerning these blinds .
One <unk> in <unk> calls them the wondrous “ whiskers ” inside of the whale ’ s mouth ; * another , “ <unk> ’ <unk> ” ; a third old gentleman in <unk> uses the following <unk> language : “ There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his upper _ <unk> _ , which <unk> over his tongue on each side of his mouth . ” * This <unk> us that the Right Whale really has a sort of <unk> , or rather a <unk> , <unk> of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw .
Sometimes these <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> expression to his otherwise solemn countenance .
As every one knows , these same “ <unk> ’ <unk> , ” “ fins , ” “ whiskers , ” “ blinds , ” or whatever you please , furnish to the ladies their <unk> and other <unk> contrivances .
But in this particular , the demand has long been on the <unk> .
It was in Queen <unk> ’ s time that the bone was in its glory , the <unk> being then all the fashion .
And as those ancient <unk> moved about <unk> , though in the jaws of the whale , as you may say ; even so , in a shower , with the like <unk> , do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for <unk> ; the <unk> being a tent spread over the same bone .
But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment , and , standing in the Right Whale ’ s mouth , look around you <unk> .
Seeing all these <unk> of bone so <unk> ranged about , would you not think you were inside of the great <unk> organ , and gazing upon its thousand pipes ?
For a <unk> to the organ we have a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> — the tongue , which is <unk> , as it were , to the floor of the mouth .
It is very fat and tender , and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck .
This particular tongue now before us ; at a passing glance I should say it was a <unk> ; that is , it will yield you about that amount of oil .
Ere this , you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with — that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads .
To sum up , then : in the Right Whale ’ s there is no great well of sperm ; no ivory teeth at all ; no long , slender <unk> of a lower jaw , like the Sperm Whale ’ s .
Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone ; no huge lower lip ; and scarcely anything of a tongue .
Again , the Right Whale has two external <unk> , the Sperm Whale only one .
Look your last , now , on these venerable hooded heads , while they yet lie together ; for one will soon sink , unrecorded , in the sea ; the other will not be very long in following .
Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale ’ s there ?
It is the same he died with , only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away .
I think his broad brow to be full of a <unk> <unk> , born of a <unk> indifference as to death .
But mark the other head ’ s expression .
See that amazing lower lip , pressed by accident against the vessel ’ s side , so as firmly to <unk> the jaw .
Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical <unk> in facing death ?
This Right Whale I take to have been a <unk> ; the Sperm Whale , a <unk> , who might have taken up <unk> in his latter years .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
Ere <unk> , for the <unk> , the Sperm Whale ’ s head , I would have you , as a sensible <unk> , simply — particularly <unk> its front aspect , in all its <unk> <unk> .
I would have you <unk> it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some <unk> , intelligent <unk> of whatever <unk> power may be lodged there .
Here is a vital point ; for you must either <unk> settle this matter with yourself , or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most appalling , but not the less true events , perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history .
You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale , the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water ; you observe that the lower part of that front <unk> considerably backwards , so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which <unk> the <unk> lower jaw ; you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head , much in the same way , indeed , as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin .
Moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose ; and that what nose he has — his spout hole — is on the top of his head ; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head , nearly one third of his entire length from the front .
Wherefore , you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale ’ s head is a dead , blind wall , without a single organ or tender <unk> of any sort whatsoever .
<unk> , you are now to consider that only in the extreme , lower , backward <unk> part of the front of the head , is there the slightest <unk> of bone ; and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full <unk> <unk> .
So that this whole enormous <unk> mass is as one wad .
<unk> , though , as will soon be revealed , its contents partly <unk> the most delicate oil ; yet , you are now to be <unk> of the nature of the substance which so <unk> invests all that <unk> <unk> .
In some previous place I have described to you how the blubber <unk> the body of the whale , as the <unk> <unk> an <unk> .
Just so with the head ; but with this difference : about the head this <unk> , though not so thick , is of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> by any man who has not handled it .
The <unk> pointed harpoon , the <unk> lance darted by the strongest human arm , <unk> <unk> from it .
It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were <unk> with horses ’ <unk> .
I do not think that any <unk> lurks in it .
<unk> yourself also of another thing .
When two large , loaded <unk> chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks , what do the sailors do ?
They do not <unk> between them , at the point of coming contact , any merely hard substance , like iron or wood .
No , they hold there a large , round wad of tow and <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> .
That <unk> and <unk> takes the <unk> which would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron <unk> .
By itself this sufficiently <unk> the obvious fact I drive at .
But <unk> to this , it has <unk> occurred to me , that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming <unk> in them , capable , at will , of <unk> or <unk> ; and as the Sperm Whale , as far as I know , has no such <unk> in him ; considering , too , the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now <unk> his head altogether beneath the surface , and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water ; considering the <unk> <unk> of its <unk> ; considering the <unk> interior of his head ; it has <unk> occurred to me , I say , that those mystical <unk> <unk> there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and <unk> connexion with the outer air , so as to be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
If this be so , fancy the <unk> of that might , to which the most <unk> and <unk> of all elements <unk> .
Now , mark .
<unk> <unk> this dead , impregnable , <unk> wall , and this most buoyant thing within ; there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous life , only to be adequately <unk> as piled wood is — by the cord ; and all <unk> to one volition , as the smallest <unk> .
So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the <unk> and <unk> of potency everywhere lurking in this <unk> monster ; when I shall show you some of his more <unk> <unk> <unk> ; I trust you will have <unk> all ignorant <unk> , and be ready to <unk> by this ; that though the Sperm Whale stove a passage through the <unk> of <unk> , and mixed the Atlantic with the Pacific , you would not <unk> one hair of your <unk> .
For unless you own the whale , you are but a <unk> and <unk> in Truth .
But clear Truth is a thing for <unk> <unk> only to encounter ; how small the chances for the <unk> then ?
What befell the <unk> youth lifting the dread <unk> ’ s veil at <unk> ?
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Great Heidelburgh Tun .
Now comes the <unk> of the <unk> .
But to comprehend it aright , you must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon .
<unk> the Sperm Whale ’ s head as a solid <unk> , you may , on an inclined plane , sideways divide it into two <unk> , * <unk> the lower is the bony structure , forming the <unk> and jaws , and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones ; its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical <unk> forehead of the whale .
At the middle of the forehead horizontally <unk> this upper <unk> , and then you have two almost equal parts , which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick <unk> substance .
* <unk> is not a <unk> term .
It belongs to the pure <unk> <unk> .
I know not that it has been <unk> before .
A <unk> is a solid which <unk> from a <unk> in having its sharp end formed by the steep <unk> of one side , instead of the mutual tapering of both sides .
The lower <unk> part , called the <unk> , is one immense <unk> of oil , formed by the crossing and <unk> , into ten thousand <unk> <unk> , of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent .
The upper part , known as the <unk> , may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale .
And as that famous great tierce is <unk> carved in front , so the whale ’ s vast <unk> forehead forms <unk> strange <unk> for the <unk> <unk> of his wondrous <unk> .
Moreover , as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the <unk> of the <unk> valleys , so the <unk> of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily <unk> ; namely , the <unk> spermaceti , in its <unk> pure , <unk> , and <unk> state .
Nor is this precious substance found <unk> in any other part of the creature .
Though in life it remains perfectly fluid , yet , upon <unk> to the air , after death , it soon begins to <unk> ; sending forth beautiful <unk> <unk> , as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water .
A large whale ’ s case generally <unk> about five hundred gallons of sperm , though from <unk> circumstances , considerable of it is spilled , <unk> , and <unk> away , or is otherwise <unk> lost in the <unk> business of securing what you can .
I know not with what fine and <unk> material the Heidelburgh Tun was <unk> within , but in <unk> <unk> that <unk> could not possibly have compared with the <unk> <unk> <unk> , like the <unk> of a fine <unk> , forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale ’ s case .
It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head ; and since — as has been elsewhere set forth — the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature , then setting that length down at <unk> feet for a good sized whale , you have more than <unk> feet for the depth of the <unk> , when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship ’ s side .
As in <unk> the whale , the <unk> ’ s <unk> is brought close to the spot where an entrance is <unk> forced into the spermaceti <unk> ; he has , therefore , to be uncommonly heedful , lest a careless , <unk> stroke should <unk> the <unk> and <unk> let out its <unk> contents .
It is this <unk> end of the head , also , which is at last elevated out of the water , and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles , whose hempen <unk> , on one side , make quite a <unk> of ropes in that quarter .
Thus much being said , attend now , I pray you , to that marvellous and — in this particular instance — almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm Whale ’ s great Heidelburgh Tun is <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> .
<unk> as a <unk> , Tashtego mounts aloft ; and without <unk> his erect posture , runs straight out upon the <unk> <unk> , to the part where it exactly <unk> over the hoisted Tun .
He has carried with him a light tackle called a whip , <unk> of only two parts , <unk> through a <unk> block .
<unk> this block , so that it hangs down from the <unk> , he swings one end of the rope , till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck .
Then , <unk> , down the other part , the Indian drops through the air , till <unk> he lands on the summit of the head .
There — still high elevated above the rest of the company , to whom he <unk> cries — he seems some Turkish <unk> calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower .
A <unk> sharp spade being sent up to him , he diligently <unk> for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun .
In this business he proceeds very <unk> , like a <unk> in some old house , sounding the walls to find where the gold is <unk> in .
By the time this <unk> search is over , a stout <unk> bucket , precisely like a <unk> , has been attached to one end of the whip ; while the other end , being stretched across the deck , is there held by two or three <unk> hands .
These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian , to whom another person has reached up a very long pole .
<unk> this pole into the bucket , Tashtego downward <unk> the bucket into the Tun , till it entirely <unk> ; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip , up comes the bucket again , all <unk> like a <unk> ’ s <unk> of new milk .
<unk> lowered from its height , the <unk> vessel is caught by an <unk> hand , and quickly <unk> into a large tub .
Then <unk> aloft , it again goes through the same round until the deep <unk> will yield no more .
Towards the end , Tashtego has to <unk> his long pole <unk> and <unk> , and deeper and deeper into the Tun , until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down .
Now , the people of the Pequod had been <unk> some time in this way ; several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm ; when all at once a queer accident happened .
Whether it was that Tashtego , that wild Indian , was so <unk> and reckless as to let go for a moment his <unk> hold on the great <unk> tackles <unk> the head ; or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and <unk> ; or whether the <unk> One himself would have it to fall out so , without <unk> his particular reasons ; how it was exactly , there is no telling now ; but , on a sudden , as the <unk> or <unk> bucket came <unk> up — my God !
poor Tashtego — like the <unk> <unk> bucket in a veritable well , dropped <unk> down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh , and with a horrible oily <unk> , went clean out of sight !
“ Man overboard ! ” cried Daggoo , who amid the general consternation first came to his <unk> .
“ <unk> the bucket this way ! ” and putting one foot into it , so as the better to secure his slippery <unk> on the whip itself , the <unk> ran him high up to the top of the head , almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom .
Meantime , there was a terrible <unk> .
<unk> over the side , they saw the before lifeless head <unk> and heaving just below the surface of the sea , as if that moment seized with some momentous idea ; whereas it was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those <unk> the perilous depth to which he had sunk .
At this instant , while Daggoo , on the summit of the head , was clearing the whip — which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles — a sharp cracking noise was heard ; and to the unspeakable horror of all , one of the two enormous hooks <unk> the head tore out , and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung , till the <unk> ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg .
The one remaining hook , upon which the entire strain now <unk> , seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way ; an event still more <unk> from the violent motions of the head .
“ Come down , come down ! ” yelled the seamen to Daggoo , but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles , so that if the head should drop , he would still remain suspended ; the negro having cleared the foul line , <unk> down the bucket into the now <unk> well , meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it , and so be hoisted out .
“ In heaven ’ s name , man , ” cried Stubb , “ are you <unk> home a <unk> there ? — Avast !
How will that help him ; <unk> that <unk> bucket on top of his head ?
Avast , will ye ! ” “ Stand clear of the tackle ! ” cried a voice like the bursting of a <unk> .
Almost in the same instant , with a <unk> , the enormous mass dropped into the sea , like <unk> ’ s <unk> into the <unk> ; the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it , to far down her glittering copper ; and all caught their breath , as half swinging — now over the sailors ’ heads , and now over the water — Daggoo , through a thick mist of spray , was dimly beheld clinging to the <unk> tackles , while poor , <unk> Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea !
But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away , when a naked figure with a <unk> in his hand , was for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks .
The next , a loud <unk> announced that my brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue .
One packed rush was made to the side , and every eye counted every <unk> , as moment followed moment , and no sign of either the <unk> or the <unk> could be seen .
Some hands now jumped into a boat alongside , and pushed a little off from the ship .
“ Ha !
ha ! ” cried Daggoo , all at once , from his now quiet , swinging perch overhead ; and looking further off from the side , we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves ; a sight strange to see , as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave .
“ Both !
both ! — it is both ! ” — cried Daggoo again with a <unk> <unk> ; and soon after , Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand , and with the other <unk> the long hair of the Indian .
<unk> into the <unk> boat , they were quickly brought to the deck ; but Tashtego was long in coming to , and Queequeg did not look very brisk .
Now , how had this noble rescue been accomplished ?
Why , diving after the slowly descending head , Queequeg with his keen sword had made side <unk> near its bottom , so as to scuttle a large hole there ; then dropping his sword , had thrust his long arm far <unk> and upwards , and so hauled out poor Tash by the head .
He <unk> , that upon first thrusting in for him , a leg was presented ; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be , and might occasion great trouble ; — he had thrust back the leg , and by a dexterous heave and toss , had wrought a <unk> upon the Indian ; so that with the next <unk> , he came forth in the good old way — head foremost .
As for the great head itself , that was doing as well as could be expected .
And thus , through the courage and great skill in <unk> of Queequeg , the deliverance , or rather , <unk> of Tashtego , was <unk> accomplished , in the teeth , too , of the most <unk> and apparently hopeless <unk> ; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten .
<unk> should be <unk> in the same course with <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and rowing .
I know that this queer adventure of the <unk> ’ s will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen , though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some one ’ s falling into a <unk> ashore ; an accident which not seldom happens , and with much less reason too than the Indian ’ s , considering the exceeding <unk> of the <unk> of the Sperm Whale ’ s well .
But , <unk> , it may be <unk> <unk> , how is this ?
We thought the <unk> , <unk> head of the Sperm Whale , was the <unk> and most <unk> part about him ; and yet thou <unk> it sink in an element of a far greater specific <unk> than itself .
We have thee there .
Not at all , but I have ye ; for at the time poor Tash fell in , the case had been nearly <unk> of its lighter contents , leaving little but the dense <unk> wall of the well — a double welded , hammered substance , as I have before said , much <unk> than the sea water , and a <unk> of which <unk> in it like lead almost .
But the <unk> to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance <unk> <unk> by the other parts of the head remaining <unk> from it , so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed , <unk> Queequeg a fair chance for performing his <unk> <unk> on the run , as you may say .
Yes , it was a running <unk> , so it was .
Now , had Tashtego perished in that head , it had been a very precious <unk> ; <unk> in the very <unk> and <unk> of fragrant spermaceti ; <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> in the secret inner <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the whale .
Only one <unk> end can readily be recalled — the <unk> death of an <unk> <unk> , who seeking <unk> in the crotch of a hollow tree , found such exceeding store of it , that leaning too far over , it sucked him in , so that he died embalmed .
How many , think ye , have likewise <unk> into <unk> ’ s <unk> head , and <unk> perished there ?
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
To <unk> the lines of his face , or feel the <unk> on the head of this Leviathan ; this is a thing which no <unk> or <unk> has as yet <unk> .
Such an <unk> would seem almost as <unk> as for <unk> to have <unk> the wrinkles on the <unk> of <unk> , or for <unk> to have mounted a ladder and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
Still , in that famous work of his , <unk> not only <unk> of the various faces of men , but also attentively <unk> the faces of horses , birds , <unk> , and fish ; and <unk> in detail upon the <unk> of expression discernible therein .
Nor have <unk> and his <unk> <unk> failed to throw out some hints touching the <unk> <unk> of other beings than man .
Therefore , though I am but ill <unk> for a <unk> , in the application of these two <unk> to the whale , I will do my endeavor .
I try all things ; I <unk> what I can .
<unk> regarded , the Sperm Whale is an <unk> creature .
He has no proper nose .
And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features ; and since it perhaps most <unk> and finally <unk> their combined expression ; hence it would seem that its entire absence , as an external <unk> , must very largely affect the countenance of the whale .
For as in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or tower of some sort , is deemed almost indispensable to the <unk> of the scene ; so no face can be <unk> in keeping without the elevated <unk> <unk> of the nose .
<unk> the nose from <unk> ’ s marble Jove , and what a sorry <unk> !
Nevertheless , Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude , all his <unk> are so stately , that the same <unk> which in the <unk> Jove were hideous , in him is no <unk> at all .
Nay , it is an added grandeur .
A nose to the whale would have been <unk> .
As on your <unk> voyage you sail round his vast head in your <unk> , your noble <unk> of him are never <unk> by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled .
A <unk> conceit , which so often will <unk> upon <unk> even when beholding the mightiest royal <unk> on his throne .
In some particulars , perhaps the most imposing <unk> view to be had of the Sperm Whale , is that of the full front of his head .
This aspect is sublime .
In thought , a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the morning .
In the repose of the pasture , the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it .
<unk> heavy <unk> up mountain <unk> , the elephant ’ s brow is majestic .
<unk> or animal , the mystical brow is as that great golden seal <unk> by the German <unk> to their <unk> .
It <unk> — “ God : done this day by my hand . ” But in most creatures , nay in man himself , very often the brow is but a mere strip of <unk> land lying along the snow line .
<unk> are the <unk> which like <unk> ’ s or <unk> ’ s rise so high , and descend so low , that the eyes themselves seem clear , eternal , <unk> mountain <unk> ; and all above them in the forehead ’ s wrinkles , you seem to track the <unk> thoughts descending there to drink , as the <unk> hunters track the snow <unk> of the <unk> .
But in the great Sperm Whale , this high and mighty <unk> dignity <unk> in the brow is so <unk> <unk> , that gazing on it , in that full front view , you feel the <unk> and the dread powers more <unk> than in beholding any other object in living nature .
For you see no one point precisely ; not one distinct feature is revealed ; no nose , eyes , ears , or mouth ; no face ; he has none , proper ; nothing but that one broad <unk> of a forehead , <unk> with <unk> ; <unk> lowering with the doom of boats , and ships , and men .
Nor , in profile , does this wondrous brow <unk> ; though that way viewed its grandeur does not <unk> upon you so .
In profile , you plainly perceive that horizontal , <unk> <unk> in the forehead ’ s middle , which , in man , is <unk> ’ s mark of <unk> .
But how ?
<unk> in the Sperm Whale ?
Has the Sperm Whale ever written a book , spoken a <unk> ?
No , his great <unk> is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it .
It is moreover declared in his <unk> silence .
And this <unk> me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young <unk> <unk> , he would have been <unk> by their <unk> thoughts .
They <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , because the <unk> is <unk> ; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue , or at least it is so exceedingly small , as to be <unk> of <unk> .
If hereafter any highly <unk> , <unk> nation shall <unk> back to their <unk> , the merry <unk> gods of old ; and <unk> <unk> them again in the now <unk> sky ; in the now <unk> hill ; then be sure , <unk> to Jove ’ s high seat , the great Sperm Whale shall lord it .
<unk> <unk> the wrinkled <unk> hieroglyphics .
But there is no <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of every man ’ s and every being ’ s face .
<unk> , like every other human science , is but a passing fable .
If then , Sir William <unk> , who read in thirty <unk> , could not read the <unk> <unk> ’ s face in its <unk> and more subtle meanings , how may <unk> Ishmael hope to read the awful <unk> of the Sperm Whale ’ s brow ?
I but put that brow before you .
<unk> it if you can .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
If the Sperm Whale be <unk> a <unk> , to the <unk> his brain seems that <unk> circle which it is impossible to square .
In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length .
<unk> the lower jaw , and the side view of this skull is as the side of a <unk> inclined plane resting throughout on a level base .
But in life — as we have elsewhere seen — this inclined plane is <unk> filled up , and almost <unk> by the enormous <unk> mass of the <unk> and sperm .
At the high end the skull forms a <unk> to bed that part of the mass ; while under the long floor of this <unk> — in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth — <unk> the mere handful of this monster ’ s brain .
The brain is at least twenty feet from his <unk> forehead in life ; it is hidden away behind its vast <unk> , like the innermost <unk> within the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
So like a choice <unk> is it <unk> in him , that I have known some whalemen who <unk> deny that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that <unk> <unk> of one formed by the <unk> of his sperm <unk> .
<unk> in strange folds , courses , and <unk> , to their <unk> , it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence .
It is plain , then , that <unk> the head of this Leviathan , in the creature ’ s living <unk> state , is an entire <unk> .
As for his true brain , you can then see no <unk> of it , nor feel any .
The whale , like all things that are mighty , wears a false brow to the common world .
If you <unk> his skull of its <unk> heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end , which is the high end , you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull , beheld in the same situation , and from the same point of view .
Indeed , place this <unk> skull ( <unk> down to the human magnitude ) among a plate of men ’ s skulls , and you would involuntarily <unk> it with them ; and <unk> the <unk> on one part of its summit , in <unk> phrase you would say — This man had no <unk> , and no <unk> .
And by those <unk> , considered along with the <unk> fact of his prodigious bulk and power , you can best form to yourself the <unk> , though not the most <unk> <unk> of what the most <unk> potency is .
But if from the comparative <unk> of the whale ’ s proper brain , you <unk> it <unk> of being adequately <unk> , then I have another idea for you .
If you attentively regard almost any <unk> ’ s spine , you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebræ to a <unk> <unk> of <unk> skulls , all bearing <unk> resemblance to the skull proper .
It is a German conceit , that the vertebræ are <unk> <unk> skulls .
But the curious external resemblance , I take it the <unk> were not the first men to perceive .
A foreign friend once pointed it out to me , in the skeleton of a foe he had slain , and with the vertebræ of which he was <unk> , in a sort of <unk> , the <unk> prow of his canoe .
Now , I consider that the <unk> have omitted an important thing in not pushing their <unk> from the <unk> through the spinal canal .
For I believe that much of a man ’ s character will be found betokened in his <unk> .
I would rather feel your spine than your skull , whoever you are .
A thin <unk> of a spine never yet <unk> a full and noble soul .
I <unk> in my spine , as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I <unk> half out to the world .
<unk> this spinal branch of <unk> to the Sperm Whale .
His <unk> cavity is continuous with the first <unk> ; and in that <unk> the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across , being eight in height , and of a triangular figure with the base downwards .
As it <unk> through the remaining vertebræ the canal tapers in size , but for a considerable distance remains of large <unk> .
Now , of course , this canal is filled with much the same strangely <unk> substance — the spinal cord — as the brain ; and directly <unk> with the brain .
And what is still more , for many feet after <unk> from the brain ’ s cavity , the spinal cord remains of an <unk> girth , almost equal to that of the brain .
<unk> all these circumstances , would it be <unk> to <unk> and <unk> out the whale ’ s spine <unk> ?
For , viewed in this light , the wonderful comparative <unk> of his brain proper is more than <unk> by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord .
But leaving this hint to <unk> as it may with the <unk> , I would merely <unk> the spinal theory for a moment , in reference to the Sperm Whale ’ s hump .
This <unk> hump , if I mistake not , rises over one of the larger vertebræ , and is , therefore , in some sort , the outer <unk> mould of it .
From its <unk> situation then , I should call this high hump the organ of <unk> or <unk> in the Sperm Whale .
And that the great monster is <unk> , you will yet have reason to know .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Pequod Meets The Virgin .
The <unk> day arrived , and we duly met the ship Jungfrau , Derick De <unk> , master , of <unk> .
At one time the greatest whaling people in the world , the Dutch and <unk> are now among the least ; but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude , you still occasionally meet with their flag in the Pacific .
For some reason , the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects .
While yet some distance from the Pequod , she rounded to , and dropping a boat , her captain was impelled towards us , <unk> standing in the bows instead of the stern .
“ What has he in his hand there ? ” cried Starbuck , pointing to something <unk> held by the German .
“ <unk> ! — a lamp-feeder ! ” “ Not that , ” said Stubb , “ no , no , it ’ s a <unk> , Mr. Starbuck ; he ’ s coming off to make us our <unk> , is the Yarman ; don ’ t you see that big <unk> can there alongside of him ? — that ’ s his boiling water .
Oh !
he ’ s all right , is the Yarman . ” “ Go along with you , ” cried Flask , “ it ’ s a lamp-feeder and an <unk> .
He ’ s out of oil , and has come <unk> . ” However curious it may seem for an <unk> to be <unk> oil on the <unk> , and however much it may <unk> <unk> the old proverb about carrying coals to <unk> , yet sometimes such a thing really happens ; and in the present case Captain Derick De <unk> did <unk> conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare .
As he mounted the deck , Ahab <unk> accosted him , without at all <unk> what he had in his hand ; but in his broken <unk> , the German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale ; immediately turning the <unk> to his lamp-feeder and oil can , with some <unk> touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness — his last drop of <unk> oil being gone , and not a single <unk> yet captured to supply the <unk> ; concluding by <unk> that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a _ clean _ one ( that is , an empty one ) , well <unk> the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin .
His <unk> supplied , Derick departed ; but he had not gained his ship ’ s side , when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mast-heads of both vessels ; and so eager for the chase was Derick , that without pausing to put his <unk> and lamp-feeder aboard , he <unk> round his boat and made after the leviathan <unk> .
Now , the game having <unk> to leeward , he and the other three German boats that soon followed him , had considerably the start of the Pequod ’ s keels .
There were eight whales , an <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of their danger , they were going all <unk> with great speed straight before the wind , rubbing their flanks as closely as so many <unk> of horses in <unk> .
They left a great , wide wake , as though continually <unk> a great wide <unk> upon the sea .
<unk> in this rapid wake , and many fathoms in the rear , swam a huge , <unk> old bull , which by his comparatively slow progress , as well as by the unusual <unk> <unk> <unk> him , seemed <unk> with the <unk> , or some other <unk> .
Whether this whale belonged to the <unk> in advance , seemed <unk> ; for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social .
Nevertheless , he stuck to their wake , though indeed their back water must have <unk> him , because the <unk> or swell at his broad <unk> was a dashed one , like the swell formed when two <unk> currents meet .
His spout was short , slow , and <unk> ; coming forth with a <unk> sort of gush , and spending itself in torn shreds , followed by strange subterranean <unk> in him , which seemed to have <unk> at his other buried extremity , <unk> the waters behind him to <unk> .
“ Who ’ s got some <unk> ? ” said Stubb , “ he has the <unk> , I ’ m afraid .
Lord , think of having half an <unk> of <unk> !
<unk> winds are holding mad Christmas in him , boys .
It ’ s the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern ; but look , did ever whale <unk> so before ?
it must be , he ’ s lost his tiller . ” As an <unk> <unk> bearing down the <unk> coast with a deck <unk> of frightened horses , <unk> , <unk> , rolls , and <unk> on her way ; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk , and now and then partly turning over on his <unk> <unk> , expose the cause of his <unk> wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin .
Whether he had lost that fin in battle , or had been born without it , it were hard to say .
“ Only wait a bit , old chap , and I ’ ll give ye a <unk> for that wounded arm , ” cried cruel Flask , pointing to the whale-line near him .
“ <unk> he don ’ t <unk> thee with it , ” cried Starbuck .
“ Give way , or the German will have him . ” With one intent all the combined <unk> boats were pointed for this one fish , because not only was he the largest , and therefore the most valuable whale , but he was nearest to them , and the other whales were going with such great velocity , moreover , as almost to <unk> pursuit for the time .
At this juncture the Pequod ’ s keels had shot by the three German boats last lowered ; but from the great start he had had , Derick ’ s boat still led the chase , though every moment neared by his foreign <unk> .
The only thing they <unk> , was , that from being already so nigh to his mark , he would be <unk> to dart his iron before they could completely <unk> and pass him .
As for Derick , he seemed quite <unk> that this would be the case , and occasionally with a <unk> <unk> shook his lamp-feeder at the other boats .
“ The <unk> and <unk> dog ! ” cried Starbuck ; “ he <unk> and <unk> me with the very <unk> I filled for him not five minutes ago ! ” — then in his old intense <unk> — “ Give way , <unk> !
<unk> to it ! ” “ I tell ye what it is , men ” — cried Stubb to his crew — “ it ’ s against my religion to get mad ; but I ’ d like to eat that <unk> Yarman — Pull — won ’ t ye ?
Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye ?
Do ye love <unk> ?
A <unk> of <unk> , then , to the best man .
Come , why don ’ t some of ye burst a <unk> ?
Who ’ s that been dropping an anchor overboard — we don ’ t <unk> an inch — we ’ re <unk> .
<unk> , here ’ s grass growing in the boat ’ s bottom — and by the Lord , the mast there ’ s <unk> .
This won ’ t do , boys .
Look at that Yarman !
The short and long of it is , men , will ye <unk> fire or not ? ” “ Oh !
see the <unk> he makes ! ” cried Flask , dancing up and down — “ What a hump — Oh , _ do _ pile on the beef — lays like a log !
Oh !
my lads , _ do _ spring — <unk> and <unk> for supper , you know , my lads — <unk> <unk> and <unk> — oh , _ do _ , _ do _ , spring , — he ’ s a hundred <unk> — don ’ t lose him now — don ’ t oh , _ don ’ t ! _ — see that Yarman — Oh , won ’ t ye pull for your <unk> , my lads — such a <unk> !
such a <unk> !
Don ’ t ye love sperm ?
There goes three thousand dollars , men ! — a <unk> ! — a whole <unk> !
The <unk> of England ! — Oh , _ do _ , _ do _ , _ do ! _ — What ’ s that Yarman about now ? ” At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the advancing boats , and also his <unk> ; perhaps with the double view of <unk> his <unk> ’ way , and at the same time <unk> <unk> his own by the <unk> <unk> of the backward toss .
“ The <unk> Dutch <unk> ! ” cried Stubb .
“ Pull now , men , like fifty thousand <unk> <unk> of <unk> devils .
What d ’ ye say , Tashtego ; are you the man to snap your spine in <unk> pieces for the honor of old <unk> ?
What d ’ ye say ? ” “ I say , pull like <unk> , ” — cried the Indian .
<unk> , but <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of the German , the Pequod ’ s three boats now began ranging almost <unk> ; and , so <unk> , <unk> neared him .
In that fine , loose , <unk> attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey , the three mates stood up <unk> , occasionally backing the after oarsman with an <unk> cry of , “ There she <unk> , now !
Hurrah for the <unk> breeze !
Down with the Yarman !
Sail over him ! ” But so decided an original start had Derick had , that spite of all their <unk> , he would have proved the <unk> in this race , had not a <unk> judgment descended upon him in a <unk> which caught the blade of his <unk> oarsman .
While this clumsy <unk> was striving to free his <unk> , and while , in consequence , Derick ’ s boat was nigh to <unk> , and he <unk> away at his men in a mighty rage ; — that was a good time for Starbuck , Stubb , and Flask .
With a <unk> , they took a mortal start forwards , and <unk> ranged up on the German ’ s quarter .
An instant more , and all four boats were <unk> in the whale ’ s immediate wake , while stretching from them , on both sides , was the <unk> swell that he made .
It was a terrific , most <unk> , and <unk> sight .
The whale was now going head out , and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet ; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright .
Now to this hand , now to that , he <unk> in his <unk> flight , and still at every billow that he broke , he <unk> sank in the sea , or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin .
So have I seen a bird with <unk> wing making affrighted broken circles in the air , vainly striving to escape the <unk> <unk> .
But the bird has a voice , and with <unk> cries will make known her fear ; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea , was <unk> up and enchanted in him ; he had no voice , save that <unk> <unk> through his spiracle , and this made the sight of him <unk> <unk> ; while still , in his amazing bulk , <unk> jaw , and omnipotent tail , there was enough to <unk> the <unk> man who so <unk> .
Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod ’ s boats the advantage , and rather than be thus <unk> of his game , Derick <unk> to <unk> what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart , ere the last chance would for ever escape .
But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke , than all three <unk> — Queequeg , Tashtego , Daggoo — instinctively sprang to their feet , and standing in a <unk> row , simultaneously pointed their barbs ; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer , their three Nantucket irons entered the whale .
<unk> vapors of foam and <unk> !
The three boats , in the first fury of the whale ’ s headlong rush , <unk> the German ’ s aside with such force , that both Derick and his <unk> harpooneer were spilled out , and sailed over by the three flying keels .
“ Don ’ t be afraid , my <unk> , ” cried Stubb , casting a passing glance upon them as he shot by ; “ ye ’ ll be picked up presently — all right — I saw some sharks astern — St.
<unk> ’ s dogs , you know — <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Hurrah !
this is the way to sail now .
Every keel a <unk> !
Hurrah ! — Here we go like three <unk> <unk> at the tail of a mad <unk> !
This <unk> me in mind of <unk> to an elephant in a <unk> on a plain — makes the <unk> fly , boys , when you fasten to him that way ; and there ’ s danger of being pitched out too , when you strike a hill .
Hurrah !
this is the way a fellow feels when he ’ s going to <unk> <unk> — all a rush down an endless inclined plane !
Hurrah !
this whale carries the everlasting <unk> ! ” But the monster ’ s run was a brief one .
<unk> a sudden <unk> , he <unk> sounded .
With a <unk> rush , the three lines flew round the <unk> with such a force as to <unk> deep grooves in them ; while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon <unk> the lines , that using all their dexterous might , they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on ; till at last — owing to the perpendicular strain from the <unk> chocks of the boats , whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue — the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water , while the three <unk> <unk> high in the air .
And the whale soon <unk> to sound , for some time they remained in that attitude , fearful of <unk> more line , though the position was a little <unk> .
But though boats have been taken down and lost in this way , yet it is this “ holding on , ” as it is called ; this <unk> up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back ; this it is that often <unk> the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes .
Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing , it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best ; for it is but reasonable to presume , that the longer the stricken whale <unk> under water , the more he is exhausted .
Because , owing to the enormous surface of him — in a full grown sperm whale something less than <unk> square feet — the pressure of the water is immense .
We all know what an <unk> <unk> weight we ourselves stand up under ; even here , <unk> , in the air ; how vast , then , the burden of a whale , bearing on his back a <unk> of two hundred fathoms of ocean !
It must at least equal the weight of fifty <unk> .
One whaleman has <unk> it at the weight of twenty <unk> ships , with all their <unk> , and <unk> , and men on board .
As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea , gazing down into its eternal blue noon ; and as not a single <unk> or cry of any sort , nay , not so much as a <unk> or a bubble came up from its depths ; what landsman would have thought , that beneath all that silence and <unk> , the utmost monster of the seas was <unk> and <unk> in agony !
Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows .
<unk> it <unk> that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock .
<unk> ?
and to what ?
To three bits of board .
Is this the creature of whom it was once so <unk> said — “ <unk> thou fill his skin with barbed irons ?
or his head with <unk> ?
The sword of him that <unk> at him cannot hold , the spear , the dart , nor the <unk> : he <unk> iron as <unk> ; the <unk> cannot make him flee ; darts are counted as <unk> ; he <unk> at the shaking of a spear ! ” This the creature ?
this he ?
Oh !
that <unk> should follow the <unk> .
For with the strength of a thousand <unk> in his tail , Leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea , to hide him from the Pequod ’ s <unk> !
In that <unk> afternoon sunlight , the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface , must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half <unk> ’ <unk> .
Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head !
“ Stand by , men ; he <unk> , ” cried Starbuck , as the three lines suddenly <unk> in the water , distinctly <unk> upwards to them , as by magnetic <unk> , the life and death <unk> of the whale , so that every oarsman felt them in his seat .
The next moment , relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows , the boats gave a sudden <unk> upwards , as a small <unk> will , when a dense herd of white bears are <unk> from it into the sea .
“ Haul in !
Haul in ! ” cried Starbuck again ; “ he ’ s rising . ” The lines , of which , hardly an instant before , not one hand ’ s breadth could have been gained , were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats , and soon the whale broke water within two ship ’ s <unk> of the hunters .
His motions plainly <unk> his extreme <unk> .
In most land animals there are certain <unk> or <unk> in many of their veins , whereby when wounded , the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions .
Not so with the whale ; one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire <unk> structure of the <unk> , so that when <unk> even by so small a point as a harpoon , a deadly <unk> is at once <unk> upon his whole <unk> system ; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface , his life may be said to pour from him in incessant <unk> .
Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him , and so distant and numerous its interior <unk> , that he will keep thus <unk> and <unk> for a considerable period ; even as in a <unk> a river will flow , whose source is in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> hills .
Even now , when the boats pulled upon this whale , and <unk> drew over his swaying flukes , and the lances were darted into him , they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound , which kept continually playing , while the natural spout-hole in his head was only at intervals , however rapid , sending its affrighted <unk> into the air .
From this last <unk> no blood yet came , because no vital part of him had thus far been struck .
His life , as they <unk> call it , was <unk> .
As the boats now more closely surrounded him , the whole upper part of his form , with much of it that is <unk> submerged , was plainly revealed .
His eyes , or rather the places where his eyes had been , were beheld .
As strange <unk> masses <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> when <unk> , so from the points which the whale ’ s eyes had once occupied , now <unk> blind <unk> , <unk> <unk> to see .
But pity there was none .
For all his old age , and his one arm , and his blind eyes , he must die the death and be murdered , in order to light the gay <unk> and other <unk> of men , and also to <unk> the solemn churches that preach unconditional <unk> by all to all .
Still rolling in his blood , at last he <unk> <unk> a strangely <unk> bunch or <unk> , the size of a <unk> , low down on the flank .
“ A <unk> spot , ” cried Flask ; “ just let me prick him there once . ” “ Avast ! ” cried Starbuck , “ there ’ s no need of that ! ” But <unk> Starbuck was too late .
At the instant of the dart an <unk> jet shot from this cruel wound , and <unk> by it into more than sufferable anguish , the whale now spouting thick blood , with swift fury blindly darted at the craft , <unk> them and their <unk> crews all over with <unk> of <unk> , <unk> Flask ’ s boat and <unk> the bows .
It was his death stroke .
For , by this time , so spent was he by loss of blood , that he <unk> rolled away from the wreck he had made ; lay <unk> on his side , <unk> <unk> with his <unk> fin , then over and over slowly revolved like a <unk> world ; turned up the white secrets of his belly ; lay like a log , and died .
It was most <unk> , that last <unk> spout .
As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain , and with <unk> melancholy <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the ground — so the last long dying spout of the whale .
Soon , while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship , the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , by Starbuck ’ s orders , lines were secured to it at different points , so that ere long every boat was a <unk> ; the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords .
By very heedful management , when the ship drew nigh , the whale was <unk> to her side , and was strongly secured there by the <unk> <unk> , for it was plain that unless <unk> <unk> , the body would at once sink to the bottom .
It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade , the entire length of a <unk> harpoon was found <unk> in his flesh , on the lower part of the bunch before described .
But as the <unk> of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales , with the flesh perfectly <unk> around them , and no <unk> of any kind to <unk> their place ; therefore , there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the <unk> alluded to .
But still more curious was the fact of a <unk> of stone being found in him , not far from the buried iron , the flesh perfectly firm about it .
Who had darted that stone lance ?
And when ?
It might have been darted by some Nor ’ West Indian long before America was discovered .
What other marvels might have been <unk> out of this monstrous <unk> there is no telling .
But a sudden stop was put to further <unk> , by the ship ’ s being <unk> dragged over sideways to the sea , owing to the body ’ s <unk> increasing <unk> to sink .
However , Starbuck , who had the <unk> of affairs , hung on to it to the last ; hung on to it so <unk> , indeed , that when at length the ship would have been <unk> , if still <unk> in <unk> arms with the body ; then , when the command was given to break clear from it , such was the <unk> strain upon the <unk> to which the <unk> and cables were fastened , that it was impossible to cast them off .
Meantime everything in the Pequod was <unk> .
To cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep <unk> <unk> of a house .
The ship <unk> and <unk> .
Many of the ivory <unk> of her bulwarks and <unk> were started from their places , by the unnatural <unk> .
In vain handspikes and <unk> were brought to bear upon the <unk> <unk> , to pry them adrift from the <unk> ; and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all <unk> , while every moment whole tons of <unk> seemed added to the sinking bulk , and the ship seemed on the point of going over .
“ Hold on , hold on , won ’ t ye ? ” cried Stubb to the body , “ don ’ t be in such a devil of a hurry to sink !
By thunder , men , we must do something or go for it .
No use <unk> there ; avast , I say with your handspikes , and run one of ye for a prayer book and a <unk> , and cut the big chains . ” “ <unk> ?
Aye , aye , ” cried Queequeg , and seizing the carpenter ’ s heavy <unk> , he leaned out of a <unk> , and steel to iron , began <unk> at the largest <unk> .
But a few <unk> , full of <unk> , were given , when the exceeding strain <unk> the rest .
With a terrific snap , every <unk> went adrift ; the ship <unk> , the carcase sank .
Now , this occasional <unk> sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale is a very curious thing ; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it .
<unk> the dead Sperm Whale floats with great <unk> , with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface .
If the only whales that thus sank were old , <unk> , and <unk> creatures , their <unk> of <unk> diminished and all their bones heavy and <unk> ; then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific <unk> in the fish so sinking , <unk> upon this absence of buoyant matter in him .
But it is not so .
For young whales , in the highest health , and <unk> with noble <unk> , <unk> cut off in the warm <unk> and May of life , with all their <unk> <unk> about them ; even these brawny , buoyant heroes do sometimes sink .
Be it said , however , that the Sperm Whale is far less <unk> to this accident than any other species .
Where one of that sort go down , twenty Right Whales do .
This difference in the species is no doubt <unk> in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale ; his <unk> blinds alone sometimes <unk> more than a <unk> ; from this <unk> the Sperm Whale is wholly free .
But there are instances where , after the <unk> of many hours or several days , the sunken whale again rises , more buoyant than in life .
But the reason of this is obvious .
<unk> are <unk> in him ; he swells to a prodigious magnitude ; becomes a sort of animal <unk> .
A <unk> ship could hardly keep him under then .
In the <unk> Whaling , on soundings , among the <unk> of New Zealand , when a Right Whale gives token of sinking , they fasten <unk> to him , with plenty of rope ; so that when the body has gone down , they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again .
It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the Pequod ’ s mast-heads , announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering her boats ; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back , belonging to the species of <unk> whales , because of its incredible power of swimming .
Nevertheless , the Fin-Back ’ s spout is so similar to the Sperm Whale ’ s , that by <unk> fishermen it is often mistaken for it .
And <unk> Derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this <unk> brute .
The Virgin crowding all sail , made after her four young keels , and thus they all disappeared far to leeward , still in bold , <unk> chase .
Oh !
many are the <unk> , and many are the <unk> , my friend .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> and <unk> of Whaling .
There are some <unk> in which a careful <unk> is the true method .
The more I dive into this matter of whaling , and push my <unk> up to the very <unk> of it so much the more am I <unk> with its great <unk> and antiquity ; and especially when I find so many great <unk> and heroes , <unk> of all sorts , who one way or other have shed distinction upon it , I am <unk> with the reflection that I myself belong , though but <unk> , to so <unk> a <unk> .
The gallant Perseus , a son of Jupiter , was the first whaleman ; and to the eternal honor of our calling be it said , that the first whale attacked by our <unk> was not killed with any <unk> intent .
Those were the <unk> days of our profession , when we only bore arms to <unk> the <unk> , and not to fill men ’ s <unk> .
Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and <unk> ; how the lovely <unk> , the <unk> of a king , was tied to a rock on the <unk> , and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off , Perseus , the <unk> of whalemen , <unk> advancing , harpooned the monster , and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
It was an admirable <unk> <unk> , <unk> achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day ; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first dart .
And let no man doubt this <unk> story ; for in the ancient Joppa , now <unk> , on the <unk> coast , in one of the Pagan <unk> , there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale , which the city ’ s <unk> and all the inhabitants <unk> to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus <unk> .
When the <unk> took Joppa , the same skeleton was carried to <unk> in <unk> .
What seems most singular and <unk> important in this story , is this : it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail .
<unk> to the adventure of Perseus and <unk> — indeed , by some supposed to be indirectly derived from it — is that famous story of St. George and the <unk> ; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale ; for in many old <unk> whales and <unk> are strangely <unk> together , and often stand for each other .
“ Thou art as a <unk> of the waters , and as a dragon of the sea , ” saith <unk> ; hereby , plainly meaning a whale ; in truth , some <unk> of the Bible use that word itself .
Besides , it would much <unk> from the glory of the <unk> had St. George but encountered a crawling <unk> of the land , instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep .
Any man may kill a <unk> , but only a Perseus , a St. George , a Coffin , have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale .
Let not the modern <unk> of this scene <unk> us ; for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely <unk> of a <unk> shape , and though the battle is <unk> on land and the <unk> on <unk> , yet considering the great ignorance of those times , when the true form of the whale was unknown to <unk> ; and considering that as in Perseus ’ case , St. George ’ s whale might have <unk> up out of the sea on the beach ; and considering that the animal <unk> by St. George might have been only a large seal , or <unk> ; bearing all this in mind , it will not appear altogether <unk> with the sacred <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the scene , to hold this <unk> dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself .
In fact , placed before the <unk> and piercing truth , this whole story will fare like that fish , flesh , and fowl idol of the <unk> , <unk> by name ; who being planted before the ark of <unk> , his horse ’ s head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him , and only the stump or fishy part of him remained .
Thus , then , one of our own noble <unk> , even a whaleman , is the <unk> <unk> of England ; and by good rights , we harpooneers of Nantucket should be <unk> in the most noble order of St. George .
And therefore , let not the <unk> of that honorable company ( none of whom , I venture to say , have ever had to do with a whale like their great <unk> ) , let them never eye a Nantucketer with <unk> , since even in our woollen <unk> and <unk> trowsers we are much better entitled to St. George ’ s <unk> than they .
Whether to admit Hercules among us or not , concerning this I long remained <unk> : for though according to the Greek <unk> , that antique <unk> and <unk> <unk> — that brawny <unk> of <unk> good <unk> , was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale ; still , whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him , that might be <unk> .
It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish , unless , indeed , from the inside .
Nevertheless , he may be deemed a sort of <unk> whaleman ; at any rate the whale caught him , if he did not the whale .
I claim him for one of our <unk> .
But , by the best <unk> authorities , this <unk> story of Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale ; and vice <unk> ; certainly they are very similar .
If I claim the <unk> then , why not the prophet ?
Nor do heroes , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> alone <unk> the whole roll of our order .
Our grand master is still to be named ; for like royal kings of old times , we find the head waters of our <unk> in nothing short of the great gods themselves .
That wondrous oriental story is now to be <unk> from the <unk> , which gives us the dread Vishnoo , one of the three persons in the <unk> of the <unk> ; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord ; — Vishnoo , who , by the first of his ten earthly <unk> , has for ever set apart and <unk> the whale .
When <unk> , or the God of <unk> , saith the <unk> , resolved to <unk> the world after one of its <unk> <unk> , he gave birth to Vishnoo , to <unk> over the work ; but the <unk> , or mystical books , whose <unk> would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before beginning the creation , and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young <unk> , these <unk> were lying at the bottom of the waters ; so Vishnoo became <unk> in a whale , and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths , <unk> the sacred <unk> .
Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman , then ?
even as a man who <unk> a horse is called a <unk> ?
Perseus , St. George , Hercules , Jonah , and Vishnoo !
there ’ s a <unk> for you !
What <unk> but the whaleman ’ s can head off like that ?
CHAPTER <unk> .
Jonah <unk> <unk> .
<unk> was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter .
Now some Nantucketers rather <unk> this historical story of Jonah and the whale .
But then there were some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , who , standing out from the <unk> pagans of their times , equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale , and <unk> and the dolphin ; and yet their <unk> those traditions did not make those traditions one <unk> the less facts , for all that .
One old <unk> whaleman ’ s chief reason for <unk> the Hebrew story was this : — He had one of those <unk> old-fashioned <unk> , <unk> with curious , <unk> plates ; one of which <unk> Jonah ’ s whale with two spouts in his head — a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan ( the Right Whale , and the varieties of that order ) , concerning which the fishermen have this saying , “ A penny roll would <unk> him ” ; his swallow is so very small .
But , to this , Bishop <unk> ’ s <unk> answer is ready .
It is not necessary , hints the Bishop , that we consider Jonah as <unk> in the whale ’ s belly , but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth .
And this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop .
For truly , the Right Whale ’ s mouth would <unk> a couple of <unk> , and <unk> seat all the <unk> .
<unk> , too , Jonah might have <unk> himself in a hollow tooth ; but , on second thoughts , the Right Whale is <unk> .
Another reason which <unk> ( he went by that name ) <unk> for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet , was something <unk> in reference to his <unk> body and the whale ’ s <unk> <unk> .
But this <unk> likewise <unk> to the ground , because a German <unk> <unk> that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a _ dead _ whale — even as the French <unk> in the <unk> <unk> turned their dead horses into <unk> , and <unk> into them .
Besides , it has been <unk> by other <unk> <unk> , that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship , he straightway <unk> his escape to another vessel near by , some vessel with a whale for a <unk> ; and , I would add , possibly called “ The Whale , ” as some craft are nowadays <unk> the “ Shark , ” the “ <unk> , ” the “ <unk> . ” Nor have there been wanting learned <unk> who have <unk> that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a <unk> — an <unk> bag of wind — which the <unk> prophet swam to , and so was saved from a watery doom .
Poor <unk> , therefore , seems <unk> all round .
But he had still another reason for his want of faith .
It was this , if I remember right : Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea , and after three days he was <unk> up somewhere within three days ’ <unk> of Nineveh , a city on the <unk> , very much more than three days ’ <unk> across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast .
How is that ?
But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of Nineveh ?
Yes .
He might have carried him round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope .
But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean , and another passage up the Persian <unk> and <unk> Sea , such a <unk> would involve the complete <unk> of all Africa in three days , not to speak of the <unk> waters , near the <unk> of Nineveh , being too <unk> for any whale to swim in .
Besides , this idea of Jonah ’ s <unk> the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would <unk> the honor of the discovery of that great <unk> from <unk> <unk> , its <unk> <unk> , and so make modern history a <unk> .
But all these foolish <unk> of old <unk> only evinced his foolish pride of reason — a thing still more <unk> in him , seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea .
I say it only shows his foolish , impious pride , and <unk> , devilish <unk> against the reverend <unk> .
For by a <unk> <unk> priest , this very idea of Jonah ’ s going to Nineveh <unk> the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal <unk> of the general <unk> .
And so it was .
Besides , to this day , the highly enlightened <unk> <unk> believe in the historical story of Jonah .
And some three centuries ago , an English traveller in old Harris ’ s Voyages , <unk> of a Turkish <unk> built in honor of Jonah , in which <unk> was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> .
To make them run easily and swiftly , the <unk> of <unk> are <unk> ; and for much the same purpose , some whalers perform an <unk> operation upon their boat ; they <unk> the bottom .
Nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm , it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage ; considering that oil and water are <unk> ; that oil is a sliding thing , and that the object in view is to make the boat slide <unk> .
Queequeg believed strongly in <unk> his boat , and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau disappeared , took more than customary pains in that <unk> ; crawling under its bottom , where it hung over the side , and rubbing in the <unk> as though diligently seeking to <unk> a <unk> of hair from the craft ’ s <unk> keel .
He seemed to be working in obedience to some particular <unk> .
Nor did it remain <unk> by the event .
Towards noon whales were raised ; but so soon as the ship sailed down to them , they turned and fled with swift <unk> ; a disordered flight , as of <unk> ’ s <unk> from <unk> .
Nevertheless , the boats pursued , and Stubb ’ s was foremost .
By great <unk> , Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron ; but the stricken whale , without at all sounding , still continued his horizontal flight , with added <unk> .
Such <unk> <unk> upon the planted iron must sooner or <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
It became <unk> to lance the flying whale , or be content to lose him .
But to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible , he swam so fast and furious .
What then remained ?
Of all the wondrous <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> of hand and countless <unk> , to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced , none exceed that fine <unk> with the lance called pitchpoling .
<unk> sword , or broad sword , in all its <unk> <unk> nothing like it .
It is only indispensable with an <unk> running whale ; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is <unk> darted from a violently rocking , jerking boat , under extreme headway .
<unk> and wood included , the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length ; the staff is much <unk> than that of the harpoon , and also of a lighter material — pine .
It is furnished with a small rope called a warp , of considerable length , by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting .
But before going further , it is important to mention here , that though the harpoon may be <unk> in the same way with the lance , yet it is seldom done ; and when done , is still less frequently successful , on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance , which in effect become serious <unk> .
As a general thing , therefore , you must first get fast to a whale , before any pitchpoling comes into play .
Look now at Stubb ; a man who from his humorous , deliberate <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , was specially <unk> to <unk> in pitchpoling .
Look at him ; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat ; <unk> in <unk> foam , the towing whale is forty feet ahead .
<unk> the long lance lightly , glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight , Stubb <unk> <unk> up the coil of the warp in one hand , so as to secure its free end in his grasp , leaving the rest <unk> .
Then holding the lance full before his <unk> ’ s middle , he <unk> it at the whale ; when , covering him with it , he steadily <unk> the <unk> in his hand , thereby <unk> the point till the weapon stands fairly <unk> upon his palm , fifteen feet in the air .
He minds you somewhat of a <unk> , <unk> a long staff on his chin .
Next moment with a rapid , nameless <unk> , in a <unk> lofty <unk> the bright steel <unk> the <unk> distance , and <unk> in the life spot of the whale .
<unk> of sparkling water , he now spouts red blood .
“ That <unk> the <unk> out of him ! ” cried Stubb .
“ ’ Tis <unk> ’ s immortal <unk> ; all <unk> must run wine <unk> !
Would now , it were old <unk> <unk> , or old <unk> , or unspeakable old <unk> !
Then , Tashtego , lad , I ’ d have ye hold a <unk> to the jet , and we ’ d drink round it !
Yea , <unk> , hearts alive , we ’ d <unk> choice punch in the spread of his spout-hole there , and from that live <unk> <unk> the living stuff . ” Again and again to such gamesome talk , the dexterous dart is repeated , the spear returning to its master like a <unk> held in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> whale goes into his <unk> ; the tow-line is slackened , and the <unk> dropping astern , folds his hands , and <unk> watches the monster die .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
That for six thousand years — and no one knows how many millions of ages before — the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea , and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the deep , as with so many <unk> or <unk> pots ; and that for some centuries back , thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale , watching these <unk> and spoutings — that all this should be , and yet , that down to this blessed minute ( fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o ’ clock <unk> of this <unk> day of December , A.D. <unk> ) , it should still remain a problem , whether these spoutings are , after all , really water , or nothing but vapor — this is <unk> a <unk> thing .
Let us , then , look at this matter , along with some interesting items <unk> .
Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills , the <unk> <unk> in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim ; hence , a herring or a cod might live a century , and never once raise its head above the surface .
But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs , like a human being ’ s , the whale can only live by <unk> the <unk> air in the open atmosphere .
Wherefore the necessity for his <unk> visits to the upper world .
But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth , for , in his ordinary attitude , the Sperm Whale ’ s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface ; and what is still more , his <unk> has no connexion with his mouth .
No , he breathes through his spiracle alone ; and this is on the top of his head .
If I say , that in any creature breathing is only a <unk> indispensable to vitality , inasmuch as it <unk> from the air a certain element , which being <unk> brought into contact with the blood <unk> to the blood its <unk> principle , I do not think I shall <unk> ; though I may possibly use some <unk> scientific words .
<unk> it , and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be <unk> with one breath , he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time .
That is to say , he would then live without breathing .
<unk> as it may seem , this is precisely the case with the whale , who <unk> lives , by intervals , his full hour and more ( when at the bottom ) without drawing a single breath , or so much as in any way <unk> a <unk> of air ; for , remember , he has no gills .
How is this ?
<unk> his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved <unk> <unk> of <unk> vessels , which vessels , when he <unk> the surface , are completely distended with <unk> blood .
So that for an hour or more , a thousand fathoms in the sea , he carries a <unk> stock of vitality in him , just as the <unk> crossing the <unk> desert carries a <unk> supply of drink for future use in its four <unk> <unk> .
The anatomical fact of this <unk> is <unk> ; and that the <unk> founded upon it is reasonable and true , seems the more cogent to me , when I consider the otherwise inexplicable <unk> of that leviathan in _ having his spoutings out _ , as the fishermen phrase it .
This is what I mean .
If <unk> , upon rising to the surface , the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time exactly <unk> with all his other <unk> <unk> .
Say he <unk> <unk> minutes , and jets seventy times , that is , <unk> seventy breaths ; then whenever he rises again , he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again , to a minute .
Now , if after he <unk> a few breaths you alarm him , so that he sounds , he will be always <unk> up again to make good his regular <unk> of air .
And not till those seventy breaths are told , will he finally go down to stay out his full term below .
<unk> , however , that in different <unk> these <unk> are different ; but in any one they are alike .
Now , why should the whale thus <unk> upon having his spoutings out , unless it be to <unk> his <unk> of air , ere descending for good ?
How obvious is it , too , that this necessity for the whale ’ s rising <unk> him to all the fatal <unk> of the chase .
For not by hook or by <unk> could this vast leviathan be caught , when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight .
Not so much thy skill , then , O hunter , as the great <unk> that strike the <unk> to thee !
In man , breathing is <unk> going on — one breath only <unk> for two or three <unk> ; so that whatever other business he has to attend to , waking or sleeping , breathe he must , or die he will .
But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one <unk> or Sunday of his time .
It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole ; if it could <unk> be added that his spouts are mixed with water , then I <unk> we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems <unk> in him ; for the only thing about him that at all <unk> to his nose is that identical spout-hole ; and being so <unk> with two elements , it could not be expected to have the power of <unk> .
But owing to the mystery of the spout — whether it be water or whether it be vapor — no absolute <unk> can as yet be arrived at on this head .
<unk> it is , nevertheless , that the Sperm Whale has no proper <unk> .
But what does he want of them ?
No roses , no <unk> , no <unk> in the sea .
<unk> , as his <unk> solely <unk> into the tube of his spouting canal , and as that long canal — like the grand <unk> <unk> — is furnished with a sort of <unk> ( that open and shut ) for the downward <unk> of air or the upward <unk> of water , therefore the whale has no voice ; unless you insult him by saying , that when he so strangely <unk> , he <unk> through his nose .
But then again , what has the whale to say ?
<unk> have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this world , unless forced to <unk> out something by way of getting a living .
Oh !
happy that the world is such an excellent <unk> !
Now , the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale , chiefly intended as it is for the <unk> of air , and for several feet laid along , horizontally , just beneath the upper surface of his head , and a little to one side ; this curious canal is very much like a <unk> laid down in a city on one side of a street .
But the question <unk> whether this <unk> is also a <unk> ; in other words , whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the <unk> breath , or whether that <unk> breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth , and <unk> through the spiracle .
It is certain that the mouth indirectly <unk> with the spouting canal ; but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of <unk> water through the spiracle .
Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be , when in feeding he accidentally takes in water .
But the Sperm Whale ’ s food is far beneath the surface , and there he cannot spout even if he would .
Besides , if you regard him very closely , and time him with your watch , you will find that when <unk> , there is an undeviating <unk> between the <unk> of his jets and the ordinary <unk> of <unk> .
But why <unk> one with all this <unk> on the subject ?
<unk> out !
You have seen him spout ; then declare what the spout is ; can you not tell water from air ?
My dear sir , in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things .
I have ever found your plain things the <unk> of all .
And as for this whale spout , you might almost stand in it , and yet be <unk> as to what it is precisely .
The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist <unk> it ; and how can you certainly tell whether any water <unk> from it , when , always , when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout , he is in a prodigious commotion , the water <unk> all around him .
And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of <unk> in the spout , how do you know that they are not merely <unk> from its vapor ; or how do you know that they are not those identical drops <unk> lodged in the spout-hole <unk> , which is <unk> into the summit of the whale ’ s head ?
For even when tranquilly swimming through the <unk> sea in a calm , with his elevated hump <unk> as a <unk> ’ s in the desert ; even then , the whale always carries a small <unk> of water on his head , as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain .
Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout .
It will not do for him to be peering into it , and putting his face in it .
You cannot go with your <unk> to this fountain and fill it , and bring it away .
For even when coming into slight contact with the outer , vapory shreds of the jet , which will often happen , your skin will <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> of the thing so touching it .
And I know one , who coming into still closer contact with the spout , whether with some scientific object in view , or otherwise , I cannot say , the skin <unk> off from his cheek and arm .
Wherefore , among whalemen , the spout is deemed <unk> ; they try to <unk> it .
Another thing ; I have heard it said , and I do not much doubt it , that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes , it will blind you .
The <unk> thing the <unk> can do then , it seems to me , is to let this deadly spout alone .
Still , we can <unk> , even if we cannot prove and <unk> .
My <unk> is this : that the spout is nothing but mist .
And besides other reasons , to this conclusion I am impelled , by considerations touching the great <unk> dignity and <unk> of the Sperm Whale ; I account him no common , <unk> being , inasmuch as it is an <unk> fact that he is never found on soundings , or near shores ; all other whales sometimes are .
He is both ponderous and profound .
And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings , such as <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , Jupiter , <unk> , and so on , there always goes up a certain <unk> steam , while in the act of thinking deep thoughts .
While <unk> a little <unk> on <unk> , I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me ; and ere long saw <unk> there , a curious involved <unk> and <unk> in the atmosphere over my head .
The <unk> <unk> of my hair , while plunged in deep thought , after six cups of hot tea in my thin <unk> <unk> , of an August noon ; this seems an additional argument for the above <unk> .
And how <unk> it raises our conceit of the mighty , <unk> monster , to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea ; his vast , mild head <unk> by a <unk> of vapor , <unk> by his <unk> <unk> , and that vapor — as you will sometimes see it — <unk> by a <unk> , as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts .
For , d ’ ye see , <unk> do not visit the clear air ; they only <unk> vapor .
And so , through all the thick <unk> of the dim doubts in my mind , divine intuitions now and then shoot , <unk> my <unk> with a heavenly <unk> .
And for this I thank God ; for all have doubts ; many deny ; but doubts or <unk> , few along with them , have intuitions .
<unk> of all things earthly , and intuitions of some things heavenly ; this <unk> makes neither <unk> nor infidel , but makes a man who <unk> them both with equal eye .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
Other <unk> have <unk> the <unk> of the soft eye of the <unk> , and the lovely <unk> of the bird that never <unk> ; less celestial , I <unk> a tail .
<unk> the largest sized Sperm Whale ’ s tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man , it <unk> upon its upper surface alone , an area of at least fifty square feet .
The <unk> round body of its root <unk> into two broad , firm , flat palms or flukes , gradually <unk> away to less than an inch in thickness .
At the crotch or <unk> , these flukes slightly <unk> , then sideways <unk> from each other like wings , leaving a wide <unk> between .
In no living thing are the lines of beauty more <unk> <unk> than in the <unk> <unk> of these flukes .
At its utmost <unk> in the full grown whale , the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across .
The entire member seems a dense <unk> bed of welded <unk> ; but cut into it , and you find that three distinct <unk> <unk> it : — upper , middle , and lower .
The fibres in the upper and lower <unk> , are long and horizontal ; those of the middle one , very short , and running <unk> between the outside <unk> .
This <unk> structure , as much as anything else , <unk> power to the tail .
To the <unk> of old Roman walls , the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of <unk> always <unk> with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique , and which <unk> <unk> so much to the great strength of the masonry .
But as if this vast <unk> power in the <unk> tail were not enough , the whole bulk of the leviathan is <unk> over with a warp and woof of <unk> fibres and <unk> , which passing on either side the <unk> and running down into the flukes , <unk> blend with them , and largely <unk> to their might ; so that in the tail the <unk> measureless force of the whole whale seems <unk> to a point .
<unk> <unk> occur to matter , this were the thing to do it .
Nor does this — its amazing strength , at all tend to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of its motions ; where <unk> of ease <unk> through a <unk> of power .
On the contrary , those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it .
<unk> strength never <unk> beauty or <unk> , but it often <unk> it ; and in everything <unk> beautiful , strength has much to do with the magic .
Take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved Hercules , and its charm would be gone .
As devout <unk> lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of <unk> , he was <unk> with the massive chest of the man , that seemed as a Roman <unk> <unk> .
When <unk> <unk> even God the Father in human form , mark what <unk> is there .
And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the <unk> , the soft , curled , <unk> <unk> pictures , in which his idea has been most <unk> <unk> ; these pictures , so <unk> as they are of all <unk> , hint nothing of any power , but the mere <unk> , <unk> one of <unk> and <unk> , which on all hands it is <unk> , form the peculiar practical <unk> of his <unk> .
Such is the subtle <unk> of the organ I <unk> of , that whether <unk> in <unk> , or in earnest , or in <unk> , whatever be the mood it be in , its <unk> are invariably marked by exceeding grace .
<unk> no <unk> ’ s arm can <unk> it .
<unk> great motions are peculiar to it .
First , when used as a fin for <unk> ; Second , when used as a <unk> in battle ; Third , in sweeping ; <unk> , in <unk> ; <unk> , in <unk> flukes .
First : Being horizontal in its position , the Leviathan ’ s tail <unk> in a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures .
It never <unk> .
In man or fish , wriggling is a sign of <unk> .
To the whale , his tail is the sole means of <unk> .
<unk> coiled forwards beneath the body , and then rapidly sprung backwards , it is this which gives that singular darting , leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming .
His <unk> only serve to steer by .
Second : It is a little significant , that while one sperm whale only <unk> another sperm whale with his head and jaw , nevertheless , in his <unk> with man , he chiefly and <unk> uses his tail .
In striking at a boat , he swiftly <unk> away his flukes from it , and the blow is only <unk> by the <unk> .
If it be made in the <unk> air , especially if it descend to its mark , the stroke is then simply irresistible .
No ribs of man or boat can withstand it .
Your only salvation lies in <unk> it ; but if it comes sideways through the opposing water , then partly owing to the light <unk> of the whale-boat , and the <unk> of its <unk> , a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two , a sort of <unk> in the side , is generally the most serious result .
These submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery , that they are accounted mere child ’ s play .
Some one <unk> off a <unk> , and the hole is stopped .
Third : I cannot <unk> it , but it seems to me , that in the whale the sense of touch is <unk> in the tail ; for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only <unk> by the <unk> of the elephant ’ s trunk .
This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping , when in <unk> <unk> the whale with a certain soft <unk> <unk> his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea ; and if he feel but a sailor ’ s <unk> , woe to that sailor , whiskers and all .
What <unk> there is in that preliminary touch !
Had this tail any <unk> power , I should straightway bethink me of <unk> ’ elephant that so frequented the <unk> , and with low <unk> presented <unk> to <unk> , and then <unk> their <unk> .
On more accounts than one , a pity it is that the whale does not possess this <unk> virtue in his tail ; for I have heard of yet another elephant , that when wounded in the fight , curved round his trunk and extracted the dart .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> upon the whale in the fancied <unk> of the middle of solitary seas , you find him <unk> from the vast <unk> of his dignity , and <unk> , he <unk> on the ocean as if it were a hearth .
But still you see his power in his play .
The broad palms of his tail are <unk> high into the air ; then smiting the surface , the <unk> <unk> <unk> for miles .
You would almost think a great gun had been <unk> ; and if you noticed the light <unk> of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity , you would think that that was the smoke from the <unk> .
<unk> : As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie considerably below the level of his back , they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface ; but when he is about to <unk> into the deeps , his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air , and so remain vibrating a moment , till they downwards shoot out of view .
<unk> the sublime _ <unk> _ — somewhere else to be described — this <unk> of the whale ’ s flukes is perhaps the <unk> sight to be seen in all animated nature .
Out of the bottomless <unk> the gigantic tail seems <unk> snatching at the highest heaven .
So in dreams , have I seen majestic <unk> thrusting forth his tormented colossal <unk> from the flame <unk> of <unk> .
But in gazing at such scenes , it is all in all what mood you are in ; if in the <unk> , the devils will occur to you ; if in that of <unk> , the <unk> .
Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that <unk> sky and sea , I once saw a large herd of whales in the east , all heading towards the sun , and for a moment vibrating in <unk> with <unk> flukes .
As it seemed to me at the time , such a grand <unk> of <unk> of the gods was never beheld , even in <unk> , the home of the fire <unk> .
As <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> elephant , I then <unk> of the whale , <unk> him the most devout of all beings .
For according to King <unk> , the military elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their <unk> uplifted in the profoundest silence .
The chance comparison in this chapter , between the whale and the elephant , so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned , should not tend to place those two opposite <unk> on an <unk> , much less the creatures to which they <unk> belong .
For as the mightiest elephant is but a <unk> to Leviathan , so , compared with Leviathan ’ s tail , his trunk is but the <unk> of a <unk> .
The most direful blow from the elephant ’ s trunk were as the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> , compared with the measureless crush and <unk> of the sperm whale ’ s ponderous flukes , which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air , very much as an Indian <unk> <unk> his <unk> .
* * Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the elephant is <unk> , inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the elephant ; nevertheless , there are not wanting some points of curious <unk> ; among these is the spout .
It is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk , and then <unk> it , jet it forth in a stream .
The more I consider this mighty tail , the more do I <unk> my <unk> to express it .
At times there are gestures in it , which , though they would well grace the hand of man , remain wholly inexplicable .
In an <unk> herd , so remarkable , occasionally , are these mystic gestures , that I have heard hunters who have declared them <unk> to <unk> signs and <unk> ; that the whale , indeed , by these <unk> <unk> <unk> with the world .
Nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body , full of <unk> , and unaccountable to his most experienced <unk> .
<unk> him how I may , then , I but go skin deep ; I know him not , and never will .
But if I know not even the tail of this whale , how understand his head ?
much more , how comprehend his face , when face he has none ?
Thou <unk> see my back parts , my tail , he seems to say , but my face shall not be seen .
But I cannot completely make out his back parts ; and hint what he will about his face , I say again he has no face .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Grand <unk> .
The long and narrow <unk> of <unk> , extending <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , forms the most <unk> point of all Asia .
In a continuous line from that <unk> stretch the long islands of Sumatra , Java , <unk> , and <unk> ; which , with many others , form a vast <unk> , or <unk> , lengthwise <unk> Asia with <unk> , and dividing the long <unk> Indian ocean from the thickly <unk> oriental archipelagoes .
This <unk> is <unk> by several <unk> for the <unk> of ships and whales ; conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and <unk> .
By the straits of Sunda , chiefly , vessels bound to China from the west , <unk> into the China seas .
Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java ; and standing midway in that vast <unk> of islands , <unk> by that bold green promontory , known to seamen as Java Head ; they not a little <unk> to the central <unk> opening into some vast <unk> <unk> : and considering the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and gold , and ivory , with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are <unk> , it seems a significant <unk> of nature , that such <unk> , by the very <unk> of the land , should at least bear the appearance , however <unk> , of being <unk> from the <unk> western world .
The shores of the Straits of Sunda are <unk> with those <unk> <unk> which guard the <unk> to the Mediterranean , the <unk> , and the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , these <unk> do not demand the <unk> homage of lowered <unk> from the endless <unk> of ships before the wind , which for centuries past , by night and by day , have passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java , <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of the east .
But while they freely <unk> a <unk> like this , they do by no means <unk> their claim to more solid <unk> .
Time out of mind the <unk> <unk> of the Malays , lurking among the low <unk> <unk> and <unk> of Sumatra , have sallied out upon the vessels sailing through the straits , fiercely <unk> <unk> at the point of their spears .
Though by the repeated bloody <unk> they have received at the hands of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of these <unk> has of late been somewhat <unk> ; yet , even at the present day , we occasionally hear of English and American vessels , which , in those waters , have been <unk> boarded and <unk> .
With a fair , fresh wind , the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits ; Ahab <unk> to pass through them into the <unk> sea , and thence , cruising <unk> , over waters known to be frequented here and there by the Sperm Whale , sweep <unk> by the <unk> Islands , and gain the far coast of Japan , in time for the great whaling season there .
By these means , the <unk> Pequod would sweep almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world , previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific ; where Ahab , though everywhere else <unk> in his pursuit , firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby Dick , in the sea he was most known to <unk> ; and at a season when he might most <unk> be presumed to be <unk> it .
But how now ?
in this <unk> quest , does Ahab touch no land ?
does his crew drink air ?
Surely , he will stop for water .
Nay .
For a long time , now , the <unk> sun has <unk> within his fiery ring , and needs no <unk> but what ’ s in himself .
So Ahab .
Mark this , too , in the whaler .
While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff , to be <unk> to foreign wharves ; the <unk> whale-ship carries no <unk> but herself and crew , their weapons and their wants .
She has a whole lake ’ s contents <unk> in her <unk> hold .
She is <unk> with <unk> ; not altogether with <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
She carries years ’ water in her .
<unk> old prime Nantucket water ; which , when three years afloat , the Nantucketer , in the Pacific , <unk> to drink before the <unk> fluid , but yesterday <unk> off in casks , from the <unk> or Indian <unk> .
Hence it is , that , while other ships may have gone to China from New York , and back again , touching at a score of ports , the whale-ship , in all that interval , may not have <unk> one <unk> of soil ; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves .
So that did you carry them the news that another flood had come ; they would only answer — “ Well , boys , here ’ s the ark ! ” Now , as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java , in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda ; indeed , as most of the ground , <unk> , was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising ; therefore , as the Pequod gained more and more upon Java Head , the look-outs were <unk> hailed , and <unk> to keep wide awake .
But though the green <unk> <unk> of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow , and with <unk> nostrils the fresh <unk> was snuffed in the air , yet not a single jet was descried .
Almost <unk> all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts , the ship had well nigh entered the straits , when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft , and ere long a spectacle of singular <unk> <unk> us .
But here be it <unk> , that owing to the <unk> activity with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans , the Sperm Whales , instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies , as in former times , are now frequently met with in <unk> herds , sometimes <unk> so great a multitude , that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had <unk> solemn <unk> and <unk> for mutual <unk> and <unk> .
To this <unk> of the Sperm Whale into such immense <unk> , may be <unk> the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds , you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together , without being <unk> by a single spout ; and then be suddenly <unk> by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands .
<unk> on both bows , at the distance of some two or three miles , and forming a great <unk> , <unk> one half of the level horizon , a continuous <unk> of <unk> were <unk> and sparkling in the <unk> air .
<unk> the straight perpendicular <unk> of the Right Whale , which , dividing at top , fall over in two branches , like the <unk> drooping <unk> of a <unk> , the single <unk> spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled <unk> of white mist , continually rising and falling away to leeward .
<unk> from the Pequod ’ s deck , then , as she would rise on a high hill of the sea , this host of vapory spouts , <unk> curling up into the air , and beheld through a blending atmosphere of <unk> <unk> , showed like the thousand cheerful <unk> of some dense <unk> , descried of a <unk> <unk> morning , by some <unk> on a height .
As marching <unk> approaching an <unk> <unk> in the mountains , <unk> their march , all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear , and once more expand in comparative <unk> upon the plain ; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits ; gradually <unk> the wings of their <unk> , and swimming on , in one solid , but still <unk> centre .
<unk> all sail the Pequod pressed after them ; the harpooneers <unk> their weapons , and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats .
If the wind only held , little doubt had they , that chased through these Straits of Sunda , the vast host would only <unk> into the Oriental seas to <unk> the capture of not a few of their number .
And who could tell whether , in that <unk> <unk> , Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming , like the <unk> <unk> in the coronation <unk> of the <unk> !
So with <unk> piled on <unk> , we sailed along , driving these leviathans before us ; when , of a sudden , the voice of Tashtego was heard , loudly <unk> attention to something in our wake .
<unk> to the <unk> in our <unk> , we beheld another in our rear .
It seemed formed of detached white vapors , rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales ; only they did not so completely come and go ; for they <unk> hovered , without finally <unk> .
<unk> his glass at this sight , Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole , <unk> , “ Aloft there , and rig <unk> and <unk> to wet the sails ; — Malays , sir , and after us ! ” As if too long lurking behind the <unk> , till the Pequod should fairly have entered the straits , these <unk> <unk> were now in hot pursuit , to make up for their <unk> <unk> .
But when the swift Pequod , with a fresh leading wind , was herself in hot chase ; how very kind of these tawny <unk> to <unk> in <unk> her on to her own <unk> pursuit , — mere <unk> and <unk> to her , that they were .
As with glass under arm , Ahab <unk> paced the deck ; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased , and in the after one the <unk> pirates chasing _ him _ ; some such fancy as the above seemed his .
And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery <unk> in which the ship was then sailing , and <unk> him that through that gate lay the <unk> to his vengeance , and beheld , how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end ; and not only that , but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and <unk> <unk> devils were <unk> cheering him on with their <unk> ; — when all these conceits had passed through his brain , Ahab ’ s brow was left gaunt and ribbed , like the black sand beach after some <unk> tide has been <unk> it , without being able to drag the firm thing from its place .
But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew ; and when , after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern , the Pequod at last shot by the vivid green <unk> <unk> on the Sumatra side , <unk> at last upon the broad waters beyond ; then , the harpooneers seemed more to <unk> that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship , than to <unk> that the ship had so <unk> gained upon the Malays .
But still driving on in the wake of the whales , at length they seemed <unk> their speed ; gradually the ship neared them ; and the wind now dying away , word was passed to spring to the boats .
But no sooner did the herd , by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale , become <unk> of the three keels that were after them , — though as yet a mile in their rear , — than they <unk> again , and forming in close <unk> and <unk> , so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of <unk> <unk> , moved on with <unk> velocity .
<unk> to our <unk> and drawers , we sprang to the <unk> , and after several hours ’ pulling were almost <unk> to <unk> the chase , when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave <unk> token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which , when the fishermen perceive it in the whale , they say he is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming , were now broken up in one measureless <unk> ; and like King <unk> ’ elephants in the Indian battle with <unk> , they seemed going mad with consternation .
In all directions <unk> in vast irregular circles , and <unk> swimming hither and thither , by their short thick spoutings , they plainly betrayed their <unk> of panic .
This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number , who , completely <unk> as it were , <unk> floated like <unk> <unk> ships on the sea .
Had these Leviathans been but a <unk> of simple <unk> , pursued over the pasture by three fierce <unk> , they could not possibly have evinced such <unk> dismay .
But this occasional <unk> is <unk> of almost all <unk> creatures .
Though <unk> together in <unk> of thousands , the <unk> <unk> of the West have fled before a solitary <unk> .
<unk> , too , all human beings , how when <unk> together in the <unk> of a <unk> ’ s pit , they will , at the slightest alarm of fire , rush <unk> for the <unk> , crowding , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> dashing each other to death .
<unk> , therefore , <unk> any amazement at the strangely <unk> whales before us , for there is no <unk> of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely <unk> by the madness of men .
Though many of the whales , as has been said , were in violent motion , yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated , but <unk> remained in one place .
As is customary in those cases , the boats at once separated , each making for some one lone whale on the <unk> of the shoal .
In about three minutes ’ time , Queequeg ’ s harpoon was flung ; the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces , and then running away with us like light , steered straight for the heart of the herd .
Though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances , is in no wise <unk> ; and indeed is almost always more or less <unk> ; yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery .
For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal , you bid <unk> to <unk> life and only <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
As , blind and <unk> , the whale plunged forward , as if by <unk> power of speed to rid himself of the iron <unk> that had fastened to him ; as we thus tore a white <unk> in the sea , on all sides <unk> as we flew , by the <unk> creatures to and fro rushing about us ; our <unk> boat was like a ship <unk> by <unk> in a tempest , and striving to steer through their complicated <unk> and straits , knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed .
But not a bit <unk> , Queequeg steered us <unk> ; now <unk> off from this monster directly across our <unk> in advance ; now <unk> away from that , whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead , while all the time , Starbuck stood up in the bows , lance in hand , <unk> out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts , for there was no time to make long ones .
Nor were the oarsmen quite <unk> , though their <unk> duty was now altogether <unk> with .
They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business .
“ Out of the way , Commodore ! ” cried one , to a great <unk> that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface , and for an instant threatened to <unk> us .
“ <unk> down with your tail , there ! ” cried a second to another , which , close to our gunwale , seemed calmly <unk> himself with his own <unk> extremity .
All <unk> carry certain curious contrivances , originally <unk> by the Nantucket Indians , called <unk> .
Two thick squares of wood of equal size are <unk> clenched together , so that they cross each other ’ s <unk> at right <unk> ; a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block , and the other end of the line being <unk> , it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon .
It is chiefly among <unk> whales that this <unk> is used .
For then , more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time .
But sperm whales are not every day encountered ; while you may , then , you must kill all you can .
And if you cannot kill them all at once , you must wing them , so that they can be afterwards killed at your <unk> .
Hence it is , that at times like these the <unk> , comes into <unk> .
Our boat was furnished with three of them .
The first and second were <unk> darted , and we saw the whales <unk> running off , <unk> by the enormous sidelong <unk> of the towing <unk> .
They were <unk> like <unk> with the <unk> and ball .
But upon flinging the third , in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block , it caught under one of the <unk> of the boat , and in an instant tore it out and carried it away , dropping the oarsman in the boat ’ s bottom as the seat slid from under him .
On both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks , but we stuffed two or three drawers and <unk> in , and so stopped the <unk> for the time .
It had been next to impossible to dart these <unk> , were it not that as we advanced into the herd , our whale ’ s way greatly diminished ; moreover , that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion , the direful <unk> seemed <unk> .
So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out , and the towing whale sideways <unk> ; then , with the tapering force of his <unk> <unk> , we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal , as if from some mountain <unk> we had slid into a serene valley lake .
Here the storms in the roaring <unk> between the <unk> whales , were heard but not felt .
In this central <unk> the sea presented that smooth <unk> surface , called a <unk> , produced by the subtle <unk> thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods .
Yes , we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion .
And still in the distracted distance we beheld the <unk> of the outer <unk> circles , and saw successive <unk> of whales , eight or ten in each , swiftly going round and round , like <unk> <unk> of horses in a ring ; and so closely shoulder to shoulder , that a <unk> <unk> might easily have <unk> the middle ones , and so have gone round on their backs .
<unk> to the <unk> of the crowd of <unk> whales , more immediately surrounding the <unk> axis of the herd , no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us .
We must watch for a <unk> in the living wall that <unk> us in ; the wall that had only <unk> us in order to shut us up .
<unk> at the centre of the lake , we were occasionally visited by small tame <unk> and calves ; the women and children of this <unk> host .
Now , <unk> of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles , and <unk> of the spaces between the various <unk> in any one of those circles , the entire area at this juncture , embraced by the whole multitude , must have contained at least two or three square miles .
At any rate — though indeed such a test at such a time might be <unk> — spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the <unk> of the horizon .
I mention this circumstance , because , as if the <unk> and calves had been <unk> locked up in this innermost <unk> ; and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto <unk> them from learning the precise cause of its stopping ; or , possibly , being so young , <unk> , and every way innocent and <unk> ; however it may have been , these smaller whales — now and then <unk> our <unk> boat from the margin of the lake — evinced a wondrous <unk> and confidence , or else a still <unk> panic which it was impossible not to <unk> at .
Like household dogs they came <unk> round us , right up to our gunwales , and touching them ; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly <unk> them .
Queequeg <unk> their <unk> ; Starbuck <unk> their backs with his lance ; but fearful of the <unk> , for the time refrained from darting it .
But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface , another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side .
For , suspended in those watery <unk> , floated the forms of the <unk> mothers of the whales , and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers .
The lake , as I have hinted , was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent ; and as human infants while <unk> will calmly and <unk> gaze away from the breast , as if leading two different lives at the time ; and while yet drawing mortal <unk> , be still <unk> <unk> upon some unearthly <unk> ; — even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us , but not at us , as if we were but a bit of <unk> in their <unk> sight .
<unk> on their sides , the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us .
One of these little infants , that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old , might have measured some <unk> feet in length , and some six feet in girth .
He was a little <unk> ; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that <unk> position it had so <unk> occupied in the maternal <unk> ; where , tail to head , and all ready for the final spring , the <unk> whale lies bent like a Tartar ’ s bow .
The delicate <unk> , and the palms of his flukes , still <unk> retained the <unk> <unk> appearance of a baby ’ s ears newly arrived from foreign parts .
“ Line !
line ! ” cried Queequeg , looking over the gunwale ; “ him fast !
him fast ! — Who line him !
Who struck ? — Two whale ; one big , one little ! ” “ What <unk> ye , man ? ” cried Starbuck .
“ <unk> here , ” said Queequeg , pointing down .
As when the stricken whale , that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope ; as , after deep sounding , he floats up again , and shows the slackened curling line <unk> rising and <unk> towards the air ; so now , Starbuck saw long coils of the <unk> cord of <unk> Leviathan , by which the young <unk> seemed still <unk> to its dam .
Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase , this natural line , with the maternal end loose , becomes entangled with the hempen one , so that the <unk> is thereby <unk> .
Some of the <unk> secrets of the seas seemed <unk> to us in this enchanted <unk> .
We saw young Leviathan <unk> in the deep .
* * The sperm whale , as with all other species of the Leviathan , but unlike most other fish , <unk> <unk> at all seasons ; after a <unk> which may probably be set down at nine months , producing but one at a time ; though in some few known instances giving birth to an <unk> and <unk> : — a <unk> provided for in <unk> by two <unk> , curiously <unk> , one on each side of the <unk> ; but the <unk> themselves <unk> upwards from that .
When by chance these precious parts in a <unk> whale are cut by the hunter ’ s lance , the mother ’ s <unk> milk and blood <unk> <unk> the sea for rods .
The milk is very sweet and rich ; it has been <unk> by man ; it might do well with <unk> .
When <unk> with mutual <unk> , the whales <unk> _ more <unk> _ .
And thus , though surrounded by circle upon circle of <unk> and <unk> , did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and <unk> <unk> in all peaceful <unk> ; yea , <unk> <unk> in <unk> and delight .
But even so , amid the <unk> Atlantic of my being , do I myself still for ever <unk> <unk> in <unk> calm ; and while ponderous <unk> of <unk> woe <unk> round me , deep down and deep inland there I still <unk> me in eternal mildness of joy .
Meanwhile , as we thus lay <unk> , the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats , still engaged in <unk> the whales on the <unk> of the host ; or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle , where abundance of room and some convenient <unk> were afforded them .
But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles , was nothing to what at last met our eyes .
It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly <unk> and <unk> , to seek to <unk> him , as it were , by <unk> or <unk> his gigantic <unk> .
It is done by darting a <unk> cutting-spade , to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again .
A whale wounded ( as we afterwards learned ) in this part , but not <unk> , as it seemed , had broken away from the boat , carrying along with him half of the harpoon line ; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound , he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted <unk> <unk> , at the battle of <unk> , carrying dismay wherever he went .
But <unk> as was the wound of this whale , and an appalling spectacle enough , any way ; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to <unk> the rest of the herd , was owing to a cause which at first the <unk> distance <unk> from us .
But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery , this whale had become entangled in the <unk> that he towed ; he had also run away with the cutting-spade in him ; and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon , had <unk> caught in the coils of the <unk> round his tail , the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh .
So that tormented to madness , he was now churning through the water , violently <unk> with his <unk> tail , and tossing the keen spade about him , <unk> and <unk> his own comrades .
This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright .
First , the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little , and <unk> against each other , as if lifted by half spent billows from afar ; then the lake itself began <unk> to heave and swell ; the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ; in more and more <unk> <unk> the whales in the more central circles began to swim in <unk> <unk> .
Yes , the long calm was <unk> .
A low advancing hum was soon heard ; and then like to the tumultuous masses of <unk> when the great river <unk> breaks up in Spring , the entire host of whales came <unk> upon their inner centre , as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain .
Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places ; Starbuck taking the stern .
“ <unk> !
<unk> ! ” he <unk> whispered , seizing the helm — “ <unk> your oars , and clutch your souls , now !
My God , men , stand by !
<unk> him off , you Queequeg — the whale there ! — prick him ! — hit him !
Stand up — stand up , and stay so !
Spring , men — pull , men ; never mind their backs — scrape them ! — scrape away ! ” The boat was now all but <unk> between two vast black <unk> , leaving a narrow <unk> between their long <unk> .
But by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening ; then giving way rapidly , and at the same time earnestly watching for another <unk> .
After many similar <unk> <unk> , we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles , but now crossed by random whales , all violently making for one centre .
This lucky salvation was <unk> <unk> by the loss of Queequeg ’ s hat , who , while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales , had his hat taken clean from his head by the <unk> made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by .
<unk> and disordered as the universal commotion now was , it soon resolved itself into what seemed a <unk> movement ; for having <unk> together at last in one dense body , they then <unk> their <unk> flight with <unk> <unk> .
<unk> pursuit was useless ; but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern , and likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and <unk> .
The waif is a <unk> pole , two or three of which are carried by every boat ; and which , when additional game is at hand , are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale , both to mark its place on the sea , and also as token of prior possession , should the boats of any other ship draw near .
The result of this lowering was somewhat <unk> of that sagacious saying in the Fishery , — the more whales the less fish .
Of all the drugged whales only one was captured .
The rest <unk> to escape for the time , but only to be taken , as will hereafter be seen , by some other craft than the Pequod .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> .
The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm Whales , and there was also then given the probable cause <unk> those vast <unk> .
Now , though such great bodies are at times encountered , yet , as must have been seen , even at the present day , small detached <unk> are occasionally observed , <unk> from twenty to fifty <unk> each .
Such <unk> are known as schools .
They generally are of two sorts ; those <unk> almost entirely of <unk> , and those <unk> none but young vigorous <unk> , or <unk> , as they are familiarly designated .
In <unk> <unk> upon the school of <unk> , you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude , but not old ; who , upon any alarm , <unk> his <unk> by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies .
In truth , this gentleman is a <unk> <unk> , swimming about over the watery world , <unk> accompanied by all the <unk> and <unk> of the harem .
The contrast between this <unk> and his <unk> is striking ; because , while he is always of the largest leviathanic <unk> , the ladies , even at full <unk> , are not more than <unk> of the bulk of an <unk> male .
They are comparatively delicate , indeed ; I dare say , not to exceed half a <unk> yards round the waist .
Nevertheless , it cannot be <unk> , that upon the whole they are <unk> entitled to _ <unk> <unk> point _ .
It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent <unk> .
Like <unk> , they are for ever on the move in <unk> search of variety .
You meet them on the Line in time for the full <unk> of the <unk> feeding season , having just returned , perhaps , from spending the summer in the Northern seas , and so <unk> summer of all <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
By the time they have <unk> up and down the <unk> of the Equator awhile , they start for the Oriental waters in <unk> of the cool season there , and so <unk> the other <unk> <unk> of the year .
When <unk> advancing on one of these <unk> , if any strange suspicious sights are seen , my lord whale keeps a <unk> eye on his interesting family .
<unk> any <unk> <unk> young Leviathan coming that way , presume to draw <unk> close to one of the ladies , with what prodigious fury the <unk> <unk> him , and <unk> him away !
High times , indeed , if <unk> young <unk> like him are to be permitted to <unk> the <unk> of domestic <unk> ; though do what the <unk> will , he cannot keep the most <unk> <unk> out of his bed ; for , alas !
all fish bed in common .
As ashore , the ladies often cause the most terrible <unk> among their <unk> <unk> ; just so with the whales , who sometimes come to deadly battle , and all for love .
They <unk> with their long lower jaws , sometimes <unk> them together , and so striving for the <unk> like <unk> that <unk> <unk> their <unk> .
Not a few are captured having the deep <unk> of these <unk> , — <unk> heads , broken teeth , <unk> fins ; and in some instances , wrenched and <unk> mouths .
But <unk> the <unk> of domestic <unk> to <unk> himself away at the first rush of the harem ’ s lord , then is it very <unk> to watch that lord .
<unk> he <unk> his vast bulk among them again and <unk> there awhile , still in <unk> vicinity to young <unk> , like pious Solomon <unk> worshipping among his thousand <unk> .
<unk> other whales to be in sight , the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these Grand <unk> ; for these Grand <unk> are too <unk> of their strength , and hence their <unk> is small .
As for the sons and the daughters they beget , why , those sons and daughters must take care of themselves ; at least , with only the maternal help .
For like certain other <unk> <unk> <unk> that might be named , my Lord Whale has no taste for the <unk> , however much for the <unk> ; and so , being a great traveller , he leaves his <unk> <unk> all over the world ; every baby an <unk> .
In good time , nevertheless , as the <unk> of youth <unk> ; as years and <unk> <unk> ; as reflection <unk> her solemn <unk> ; in short , as a general <unk> <unk> the <unk> Turk ; then a love of ease and virtue <unk> the love for <unk> ; our <unk> enters upon the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stage of life , <unk> , <unk> the harem , and grown to an <unk> , <unk> old soul , goes about all alone among the meridians and <unk> saying his prayers , and warning each young Leviathan from his <unk> <unk> .
Now , as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school , so is the lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster .
It is therefore not in <unk> character , however <unk> <unk> , that after going to school himself , he should then go abroad <unk> not what he learned there , but the <unk> of it .
His title , schoolmaster , would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself , but some have <unk> that the man who first thus entitled this sort of <unk> whale , must have read the <unk> of <unk> , and informed himself what sort of a <unk> that famous Frenchman was in his <unk> days , and what was the nature of those <unk> <unk> he <unk> into some of his <unk> .
The same <unk> and <unk> to which the schoolmaster whale <unk> himself in his advancing years , is true of all aged Sperm Whales .
Almost <unk> , a lone whale — as a solitary Leviathan is called — <unk> an ancient one .
Like venerable <unk> <unk> <unk> , he will have no one near him but Nature herself ; and her he takes to wife in the <unk> of waters , and the best of wives she is , though she keeps so many moody secrets .
The schools <unk> none but young and vigorous <unk> , previously mentioned , offer a strong contrast to the harem schools .
For while those <unk> whales are <unk> timid , the young <unk> , or <unk> , as they call them , are by far the most <unk> of all Leviathans , and <unk> the most dangerous to encounter ; <unk> those wondrous <unk> , <unk> whales , sometimes met , and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> schools are larger than the harem schools .
Like a mob of young <unk> , they are full of fight , fun , and <unk> , <unk> round the world at such a reckless , <unk> rate , that no prudent <unk> would <unk> them any more than he would a <unk> lad at <unk> or <unk> .
They soon <unk> this <unk> though , and when about <unk> grown , break up , and separately go about in quest of <unk> , that is , <unk> .
Another point of difference between the male and <unk> schools is still more <unk> of the <unk> .
Say you strike a <unk> — poor devil !
all his comrades quit him .
But strike a member of the harem school , and her companions swim around her with every token of concern , sometimes lingering so near her and so long , as themselves to fall a prey .
CHAPTER <unk> .
Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish .
The allusion to the waif and <unk> in the last chapter but one , <unk> some account of the laws and <unk> of the whale fishery , of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and <unk> .
It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company , a whale may be struck by one vessel , then escape , and be finally killed and captured by another vessel ; and <unk> are indirectly <unk> many <unk> <unk> , all <unk> of this one grand feature .
For example , — after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale , the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm ; and <unk> far away to leeward , be <unk> by a second whaler , who , in a calm , snugly <unk> it alongside , without risk of life or line .
Thus the most <unk> and violent <unk> would often <unk> between the fishermen , were there not some written or <unk> , universal , <unk> law applicable to all cases .
Perhaps the only <unk> whaling <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> , was that of Holland .
It was <unk> by the <unk> in A.D. <unk> .
But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law , yet the American fishermen have been their own <unk> and <unk> in this matter .
They have provided a system which for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ’ s <unk> and the <unk> of the Chinese <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> with other People ’ s <unk> .
Yes ; these laws might be <unk> on a Queen <unk> ’ s <unk> , or the barb of a harpoon , and worn round the neck , so small are they .
I.
A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it .
II .
A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can <unk> catch it .
But what <unk> the <unk> with this <unk> <unk> is the admirable <unk> of it , which <unk> a vast volume of <unk> to <unk> it .
First : What is a Fast-Fish ?
<unk> or dead a fish is technically fast , when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat , by any medium at all <unk> by the <unk> or <unk> , — a mast , an oar , a <unk> cable , a <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> of <unk> , it is all the same .
Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif , or any other recognised symbol of possession ; so long as the party <unk> it plainly <unk> their <unk> at any time to take it alongside , as well as their intention so to do .
These are scientific <unk> ; but the <unk> of the whalemen themselves sometimes <unk> in hard words and <unk> <unk> — the <unk> of the <unk> .
True , among the more upright and honorable whalemen <unk> are always made for peculiar cases , where it would be an <unk> <unk> <unk> for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party .
But others are by no means so <unk> .
Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of <unk> <unk> in England , wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas ; and when indeed they ( the plaintiffs ) had succeeded in <unk> the fish ; they were at last , through peril of their lives , obliged to <unk> not only their lines , but their boat itself .
<unk> the defendants ( the crew of another ship ) came up with the whale , struck , killed , seized , and finally <unk> it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs .
And when those defendants were <unk> with , their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs ’ teeth , and assured them that by way of <unk> to the deed he had done , he would now retain their line , harpoons , and boat , which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the <unk> .
Wherefore the plaintiffs now <unk> for the <unk> of the value of their whale , line , harpoons , and boat .
Mr. <unk> was <unk> for the defendants ; Lord <unk> was the judge .
In the course of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> went on to <unk> his position , by <unk> to a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> .
case , wherein a gentleman , after in vain trying to <unk> his wife ’ s <unk> , had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life ; but in the course of years , <unk> of that step , he <unk> an action to <unk> possession of her .
<unk> was on the other side ; and he then <unk> it by saying , that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady , and had once had her fast , and only by reason of the great <unk> of her plunging <unk> , had at last abandoned her ; yet <unk> her he did , so that she became a <unk> ; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman <unk> her , the lady then became that subsequent gentleman ’ s property , along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her .
Now in the present case <unk> <unk> that the <unk> of the whale and the lady were <unk> <unk> of each other .
These <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , being duly heard , the very learned judge in set terms decided , to <unk> , — That as for the boat , he <unk> it to the plaintiffs , because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives ; but that with regard to the <unk> whale , harpoons , and line , they belonged to the defendants ; the whale , because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture ; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them , it ( the fish ) <unk> a property in those articles ; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them .
Now the defendants afterwards took the fish ; <unk> , the <unk> articles were theirs .
A common man looking at this <unk> of the very learned <unk> , might possibly object to it .
But <unk> up to the <unk> rock of the matter , the two great principles laid down in the <unk> whaling laws previously <unk> , and applied and <unk> by Lord <unk> in the above <unk> case ; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish , I say , will , on reflection , be found the <unk> of all human <unk> ; for notwithstanding its complicated <unk> of <unk> , the Temple of the <unk> , like the Temple of the <unk> , has but two <unk> to stand on .
Is it not a saying in every one ’ s mouth , <unk> is half of the law : that is , <unk> of how the thing came into possession ?
But often possession is the whole of the law .
What are the <unk> and souls of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but Fast-Fish , <unk> possession is the whole of the law ?
What to the <unk> landlord is the widow ’ s last <unk> but a Fast-Fish ?
What is yonder <unk> <unk> ’ s marble <unk> with a <unk> for a waif ; what is that but a Fast-Fish ?
What is the <unk> <unk> which <unk> , the <unk> , gets from poor <unk> , the <unk> , on a <unk> to keep <unk> ’ s family from <unk> ; what is that <unk> <unk> but a Fast-Fish ?
What is the <unk> of <unk> ’ s <unk> of £ <unk> seized from the <unk> bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of <unk> laborers ( all sure of heaven without any of <unk> ’ s help ) what is that globular £ <unk> but a Fast-Fish ?
What are the Duke of <unk> ’ s hereditary towns and <unk> but Fast-Fish ?
What to that <unk> harpooneer , John <unk> , is poor <unk> , but a Fast-Fish ?
What to that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , is <unk> but a Fast-Fish ?
And concerning all these , is not <unk> the whole of the law ?
But if the <unk> of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable , the kindred <unk> of Loose-Fish is still more widely so .
That is <unk> and <unk> applicable .
What was America in <unk> but a Loose-Fish , in which <unk> struck the Spanish <unk> by way of <unk> it for his royal master and <unk> ?
What was <unk> to the Czar ?
What <unk> to the Turk ?
What India to England ?
What at last will <unk> be to the United States ?
All Loose-Fish .
What are the <unk> of Man and the <unk> of the <unk> but Loose-Fish ?
What all men ’ s minds and <unk> but Loose-Fish ?
What is the principle of <unk> belief in them but a Loose-Fish ?
What to the <unk> <unk> <unk> are the thoughts of <unk> but Loose-Fish ?
What is the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish ?
And what are you , reader , but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish , too ?
CHAPTER 90 .
<unk> or <unk> .
“ De <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> . ” _ <unk> , <unk> . 3 , <unk> . 3 . _ Latin from the books of the <unk> of England , which taken along with the <unk> , means , that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land , the King , as <unk> Grand <unk> , must have the head , and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail .
A <unk> which , in the whale , is much like <unk> an <unk> ; there is no <unk> <unk> .
Now as this law , under a modified form , is to this day in force in England ; and as it <unk> in various respects a strange <unk> touching the general law of <unk> and Loose-Fish , it is here treated of in a separate chapter , on the same <unk> principle that <unk> the English <unk> to be at the expense of a separate <unk> , specially reserved for the <unk> of royalty .
In the first place , in curious <unk> of the fact that the <unk> law is still in force , I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two years .
It seems that some honest mariners of <unk> , or <unk> , or some one of the <unk> <unk> , had after a hard chase succeeded in <unk> and <unk> a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore .
Now the <unk> <unk> are <unk> or somehow under the <unk> of a sort of <unk> or <unk> , called a Lord <unk> .
<unk> the office directly from the crown , I believe , all the royal <unk> incident to the <unk> <unk> <unk> become by <unk> his .
By some <unk> this office is called a <unk> .
But not so .
Because the Lord <unk> is <unk> employed at times in <unk> his <unk> ; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same <unk> of them .
Now when these poor <unk> mariners , <unk> , and with their trowsers rolled high up on their <unk> legs , had <unk> hauled their fat fish high and dry , promising themselves a good £ <unk> from the precious oil and bone ; and in <unk> <unk> rare tea with their wives , and good ale with their <unk> , upon the strength of their respective <unk> ; up steps a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman , with a copy of <unk> under his arm ; and laying it upon the whale ’ s head , he says — “ Hands off !
this fish , my <unk> , is a Fast-Fish .
I seize it as the Lord <unk> ’ s . ” Upon this the poor mariners in their <unk> consternation — so truly English — knowing not what to say , fall to vigorously <unk> their heads all round ; meanwhile <unk> glancing from the whale to the stranger .
But that did in <unk> mend the matter , or at all <unk> the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of <unk> .
At length one of them , after long <unk> about for his ideas , made bold to speak , “ <unk> , sir , who is the Lord <unk> ? ” “ The Duke . ” “ But the <unk> had nothing to do with taking this fish ? ” “ It is his . ” “ We have been at great trouble , and peril , and some expense , and is all that to go to the Duke ’ s <unk> ; we getting nothing at all for our pains but our <unk> ? ” “ It is his . ” “ Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate <unk> of getting a <unk> ? ” “ It is his . ” “ I thought to <unk> my old <unk> mother by part of my share of this whale . ” “ It is his . ” “ <unk> ’ t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half ? ” “ It is his . ” In a word , the whale was seized and <unk> , and his Grace the Duke of <unk> received the money .
<unk> that viewed in some particular lights , the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed , under the circumstances , a rather hard one , an honest <unk> of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace , <unk> him to take the case of those <unk> mariners into full consideration .
To which my Lord Duke in substance replied ( both letters were published ) that he had already done so , and received the money , and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he ( the reverend gentleman ) would <unk> <unk> with other people ’ s business .
Is this the still <unk> old man , standing at the corners of the three <unk> , on all hands <unk> <unk> of <unk> ?
It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to the whale was a <unk> one from the <unk> .
We must needs <unk> then on what principle the <unk> is originally invested with that right .
The law itself has already been set forth .
But <unk> gives us the reason for it .
<unk> <unk> , the whale so caught belongs to the King and Queen , “ because of its superior <unk> . ” And by the <unk> <unk> this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters .
But why should the King have the head , and the Queen the tail ?
A reason for that , ye <unk> !
In his <unk> on “ <unk> , ” or <unk> , an old King ’ s <unk> author , one William <unk> , thus <unk> : “ Ye tail is ye Queen ’ s , that ye Queen ’ s <unk> may be supplied with ye whalebone . ” Now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies ’ <unk> .
But this same bone is not in the tail ; it is in the head , which is a sad mistake for a sagacious <unk> like <unk> .
But is the Queen a <unk> , to be presented with a tail ?
An <unk> meaning may lurk here .
There are two royal fish so <unk> by the English law <unk> — the whale and the <unk> ; both royal property under certain <unk> , and <unk> <unk> the tenth branch of the crown ’ s ordinary <unk> .
I know not that any other author has hinted of the matter ; but by inference it seems to me that the <unk> must be divided in the same way as the whale , the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish , which , <unk> regarded , may possibly be humorously <unk> upon some presumed <unk> .
And thus there seems a reason in all things , even in law .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Pequod Meets The <unk> .
“ In vain it was to <unk> for <unk> in the <unk> of this Leviathan , insufferable <unk> <unk> not inquiry . ” _ Sir T. Browne , <unk> _ It was a week or two after the last whaling scene <unk> , and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy , vapory , <unk> sea , that the many noses on the Pequod ’ s deck proved more <unk> <unk> than the three <unk> of eyes aloft .
A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was <unk> in the sea .
“ I will <unk> something now , ” said Stubb , “ that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we <unk> the other day .
I thought they would keel up before long . ” Presently , the vapors in advance slid aside ; and there in the distance lay a ship , whose <unk> sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside .
As we glided nearer , the stranger showed French colours from his <unk> ; and by the eddying <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> , and hovered , and <unk> around him , it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale , that is , a whale that has died <unk> on the sea , and so floated an <unk> corpse .
It may well be <unk> , what an <unk> odor such a mass must <unk> ; worse than an <unk> city in the plague , when the living are <unk> to bury the departed .
So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some , that no <unk> could <unk> them to <unk> alongside of it .
Yet are there those who will still do it ; notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality , and by no means of the nature of <unk> .
Coming still nearer with the <unk> breeze , we saw that the Frenchman had a second whale alongside ; and this second whale seemed even more of a <unk> than the first .
In truth , it turned out to be one of those <unk> whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia , or <unk> ; leaving their <unk> bodies almost entirely <unk> of anything like oil .
Nevertheless , in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this , however much he may <unk> blasted whales in general .
The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger , that Stubb <unk> he recognised his cutting <unk> entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales .
“ There ’ s a pretty fellow , now , ” he <unk> laughed , standing in the ship ’ s bows , “ there ’ s a <unk> for ye !
I well know that these <unk> of <unk> are but poor devils in the fishery ; sometimes lowering their boats for breakers , <unk> them for Sperm Whale spouts ; yes , and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of <unk> candles , and cases of <unk> , <unk> that all the oil they will get won ’ t be enough to dip the Captain ’ s <unk> into ; aye , we all know these things ; but look ye , here ’ s a <unk> that is content with our <unk> , the drugged whale there , I mean ; aye , and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there .
Poor devil !
I say , pass round a hat , some one , and let ’ s make him a present of a little oil for dear <unk> ’ s sake .
For what oil he ’ ll get from that drugged whale there , wouldn ’ t be fit to burn in a <unk> ; no , not in a condemned <unk> .
And as for the other whale , why , I ’ ll agree to get more oil by <unk> up and trying out these three masts of ours , than he ’ ll get from that <unk> of bones ; though , now that I think of it , it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil ; yes , ambergris .
I wonder now if our old man has thought of that .
It ’ s worth trying .
Yes , I ’ m for it ; ” and so saying he started for the quarter-deck .
By this time the faint air had become a complete calm ; so that whether or no , the Pequod was now fairly <unk> in the smell , with no hope of <unk> except by its <unk> up again .
<unk> from the cabin , Stubb now called his boat ’ s crew , and pulled off for the stranger .
<unk> across her bow , he perceived that in accordance with the <unk> French taste , the upper part of her <unk> was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping <unk> , was painted green , and for <unk> had copper <unk> projecting from it here and there ; the whole <unk> in a <unk> folded <unk> of a bright red colour .
Upon her head <unk> , in large <unk> letters , he read “ <unk> de <unk> , ” — <unk> , or <unk> ; and this was the romantic name of this <unk> ship .
Though Stubb did not understand the _ <unk> _ part of the <unk> , yet the word _ rose _ , and the <unk> <unk> put together , sufficiently explained the whole to him .
“ A wooden <unk> , eh ? ” he cried with his hand to his nose , “ that will do very well ; but how like all creation it smells ! ” Now in order to hold direct <unk> with the people on deck , he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side , and thus come close to the blasted whale ; and so talk over it .
<unk> then at this spot , with one hand still to his nose , he <unk> — “ <unk> , ahoy !
are there any of you <unk> that speak English ? ” “ Yes , ” <unk> a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks , who turned out to be the chief-mate .
“ Well , then , my <unk> , have you seen the White Whale ? ” “ _ What _ whale ? ” “ The _ White _ Whale — a Sperm Whale — Moby Dick , have ye seen him ?
“ Never heard of such a whale .
<unk> <unk> !
White Whale — no . ” “ Very good , then ; good <unk> now , and I ’ ll call again in a minute . ” Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod , and seeing Ahab leaning over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report , he <unk> his two hands into a trumpet and shouted — “ No , Sir !
No ! ” Upon which Ahab retired , and Stubb returned to the Frenchman .
He now perceived that the Guernsey-man , who had just got into the chains , and was using a cutting-spade , had <unk> his nose in a sort of bag .
“ What ’ s the matter with your nose , there ? ” said Stubb .
“ <unk> it ? ” “ I wish it was broken , or that I didn ’ t have any nose at all ! ” answered the Guernsey-man , who did not seem to <unk> the job he was at very much .
“ But what are you holding _ yours _ for ? ” “ Oh , nothing !
It ’ s a <unk> nose ; I have to hold it on .
<unk> day , ain ’ t it ?
<unk> rather <unk> , I should say ; throw us a bunch of <unk> , will ye , <unk> ? ” “ What in the devil ’ s name do you want here ? ” roared the <unk> , flying into a sudden passion .
“ Oh !
keep cool — cool ?
yes , that ’ s the word !
why don ’ t you pack those whales in ice while you ’ re working at ’ em ?
But <unk> aside , though ; do you know , <unk> , that it ’ s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales ?
As for that dried up one , there , he hasn ’ t a <unk> in his whole carcase . ” “ I know that well enough ; but , d ’ ye see , the Captain here won ’ t believe it ; this is his first voyage ; he was a <unk> <unk> before .
But come aboard , and <unk> he ’ ll believe you , if he won ’ t me ; and so I ’ ll get out of this <unk> scrape . ” “ <unk> to <unk> ye , my sweet and pleasant fellow , ” <unk> Stubb , and with that he soon mounted to the deck .
There a queer scene presented itself .
The sailors , in <unk> <unk> of red <unk> , were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales .
But they worked rather slow and talked very fast , and seemed in anything but a good humor .
All their noses <unk> <unk> from their faces like so many <unk> .
Now and then <unk> of them would drop their work , and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air .
Some thinking they would catch the plague , <unk> oakum in <unk> , and at intervals held it to their nostrils .
<unk> having broken the <unk> of their pipes almost short off at the bowl , were vigorously puffing <unk> , so that it <unk> filled their <unk> .
Stubb was struck by a shower of <unk> and <unk> proceeding from the Captain ’ s <unk> <unk> ; and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door , which was held <unk> from within .
This was the tormented surgeon , who , after in vain <unk> against the proceedings of the day , had <unk> himself to the Captain ’ s <unk> ( _ <unk> _ he called it ) to avoid the <unk> ; but still , could not help <unk> out his <unk> and <unk> at times .
<unk> all this , Stubb argued well for his <unk> , and turning to the Guernsey-man had a little chat with him , during which the stranger mate expressed his <unk> of his Captain as a <unk> <unk> , who had brought them all into so <unk> and <unk> a pickle .
<unk> him carefully , Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris .
He therefore held his peace on that head , but otherwise was quite <unk> and confidential with him , so that the two quickly <unk> a little plan for both <unk> and <unk> the Captain , without his at all dreaming of <unk> their <unk> .
According to this little plan of theirs , the Guernsey-man , under cover of an <unk> ’ s office , was to tell the Captain what he pleased , but as coming from Stubb ; and as for Stubb , he was to utter any nonsense that should come <unk> in him during the <unk> .
By this time their destined <unk> appeared from his cabin .
He was a small and dark , but rather delicate looking man for a <unk> , with large whiskers and <unk> , however ; and wore a red <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> at his side .
To this gentleman , Stubb was now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man , who at once <unk> put on the aspect of <unk> between them .
“ What shall I say to him first ? ” said he .
“ Why , ” said Stubb , eyeing the <unk> <unk> and the watch and seals , “ you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of <unk> to me , though I don ’ t pretend to be a judge . ” “ He says , Monsieur , ” said the Guernsey-man , in French , turning to his captain , “ that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel , whose captain and chief-mate , with six sailors , had all died of a <unk> caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside . ” Upon this the captain started , and eagerly desired to know more .
“ What now ? ” said the Guernsey-man to Stubb .
“ Why , since he takes it so easy , tell him that now I have eyed him carefully , I ’ m quite certain that he ’ s no more fit to command a whale-ship than a St. <unk> monkey .
In fact , tell him from me he ’ s a <unk> . ” “ He <unk> and <unk> , Monsieur , that the other whale , the dried one , is far more deadly than the blasted one ; in fine , Monsieur , he <unk> us , as we value our lives , to cut loose from these fish . ” Instantly the captain ran forward , and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the <unk> , and at once cast loose the cables and chains <unk> the whales to the ship .
“ What now ? ” said the Guernsey-man , when the Captain had returned to them .
“ Why , let me see ; yes , you may as well tell him now that — that — in fact , tell him I ’ ve <unk> him , and ( aside to himself ) perhaps somebody else . ” “ He says , Monsieur , that he ’ s very happy to have been of any service to us . ” <unk> this , the captain <unk> that they were the <unk> parties ( meaning himself and mate ) and concluded by <unk> Stubb down into his cabin to drink a <unk> of <unk> .
“ He wants you to take a glass of wine with him , ” said the <unk> .
“ <unk> him <unk> ; but tell him it ’ s against my principles to drink with the man I ’ ve <unk> .
In fact , tell him I must go . ” “ He says , Monsieur , that his principles won ’ t admit of his drinking ; but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink , then Monsieur had best drop all four boats , and pull the ship away from these whales , for it ’ s so calm they won ’ t <unk> . ” By this time Stubb was over the side , and getting into his boat , hailed the Guernsey-man to this effect , — that having a long tow-line in his boat , he would do what he could to help them , by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship ’ s side .
While the Frenchman ’ s boats , then , were engaged in towing the ship one way , Stubb <unk> towed away at his whale the other way , <unk> <unk> out a most unusually long tow-line .
Presently a breeze sprang up ; Stubb <unk> to cast off from the whale ; hoisting his boats , the Frenchman soon increased his distance , while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb ’ s whale .
<unk> Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body , and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his <unk> , at once proceeded to <unk> the <unk> of his <unk> cunning .
<unk> his sharp <unk> , he commenced an <unk> in the body , a little behind the side fin .
You would almost have thought he was <unk> a <unk> there in the sea ; and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs , it was like turning up old Roman <unk> and <unk> buried in fat English <unk> .
His boat ’ s crew were all in high excitement , eagerly helping their chief , and looking as anxious as <unk> .
And all the time numberless fowls were diving , and <unk> , and screaming , and <unk> , and fighting around them .
Stubb was beginning to look <unk> , especially as the horrible <unk> increased , when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague , there stole a faint stream of <unk> , which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it , as one river will flow into and then along with another , without at all blending with it for a time .
“ I have it , I have it , ” cried Stubb , with delight , striking something in the subterranean <unk> , “ a purse !
a purse ! ” <unk> his spade , he thrust both hands in , and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe <unk> <unk> , or rich <unk> old cheese ; very unctuous and <unk> <unk> .
You might easily <unk> it with your <unk> ; it is of a hue between yellow and <unk> colour .
And this , good friends , is ambergris , worth a gold <unk> an ounce to any <unk> .
Some six handfuls were obtained ; but more was <unk> lost in the sea , and still more , perhaps , might have been secured were it not for impatient Ahab ’ s loud command to Stubb to desist , and come on board , else the ship would bid them good <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> .
Now this ambergris is a very curious substance , and so important as an article of commerce , that in <unk> a certain <unk> Captain Coffin was <unk> at the bar of the English <unk> of <unk> on that subject .
For at that time , and indeed until a comparatively late day , the precise <unk> of ambergris remained , like amber itself , a problem to the learned .
Though the word ambergris is but the French <unk> for grey amber , yet the two <unk> are quite distinct .
For amber , though at times found on the <unk> , is also <unk> up in some far inland <unk> , whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea .
Besides , amber is a hard , transparent , <unk> , <unk> substance , used for <unk> to pipes , for <unk> and <unk> ; but ambergris is soft , <unk> , and so highly fragrant and <unk> , that it is largely used in <unk> , in <unk> , precious candles , <unk> , and <unk> .
The <unk> use it in <unk> , and also carry it to <unk> , for the same purpose that <unk> is carried to St. Peter ’ s in Rome .
Some wine <unk> drop a few <unk> into <unk> , to flavor it .
Who would think , then , that such fine ladies and gentlemen should <unk> themselves with an <unk> found in the <unk> bowels of a sick whale !
Yet so it is .
By some , ambergris is supposed to be the cause , and by others the effect , of the dyspepsia in the whale .
How to <unk> such a dyspepsia it were hard to say , unless by <unk> three or four boat <unk> of <unk> ’ s <unk> , and then running out of harm ’ s way , as laborers do in <unk> rocks .
I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris , certain hard , round , bony plates , which at first Stubb thought might be sailors ’ trowsers <unk> ; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of small <unk> bones embalmed in that manner .
Now that the <unk> of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such <unk> ; is this nothing ?
<unk> thee of that saying of St. Paul in <unk> , about <unk> and <unk> ; how that we are <unk> in <unk> , but raised in glory .
And likewise call to mind that saying of <unk> about what it is that maketh the best musk .
<unk> forget not the strange fact that of all things of <unk> , <unk> , in its <unk> <unk> <unk> , is the <unk> .
I should like to conclude the chapter with the above <unk> , but cannot , owing to my <unk> to <unk> a charge often made against whalemen , and which , in the <unk> of some already <unk> minds , might be considered as indirectly <unk> by what has been said of the Frenchman ’ s two whales .
<unk> in this volume the <unk> <unk> has been <unk> , that the vocation of whaling is throughout a <unk> , <unk> business .
But there is another thing to <unk> .
They hint that all whales always smell bad .
Now how did this <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
I <unk> , that it is plainly <unk> to the first arrival of the Greenland whaling ships in London , more than two centuries ago .
Because those whalemen did not then , and do not now , try out their oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done ; but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits , thrust it through the <unk> <unk> of large casks , and carry it home in that manner ; the <unk> of the season in those <unk> Seas , and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed , <unk> any other course .
The consequence is , that upon breaking into the hold , and <unk> one of these whale <unk> , in the Greenland <unk> , a <unk> is given forth somewhat similar to that <unk> from <unk> an old city <unk> , for the foundations of a <unk> <unk> .
I partly <unk> also , that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise <unk> to the existence on the coast of Greenland , in former times , of a Dutch village called <unk> or <unk> , which latter name is the one used by the learned <unk> <unk> <unk> , in his great work on <unk> , a <unk> on that subject .
As its name <unk> ( <unk> , fat ; <unk> , to put up ) , this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out , without being taken home to Holland for that purpose .
It was a collection of <unk> , <unk> , and oil <unk> ; and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant <unk> .
But all this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm <unk> ; which in a voyage of four years perhaps , after completely filling her hold with oil , does not , perhaps , <unk> fifty days in the business of boiling out ; and in the state that it is <unk> , the oil is nearly <unk> .
The truth is , that living or dead , if but <unk> treated , whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor ; nor can whalemen be recognised , as the people of the middle ages affected to <unk> a <unk> in the company , by the nose .
Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant , when , as a general thing , he <unk> such high health ; taking abundance of <unk> ; always out of doors ; though , it is true , seldom in the open air .
I say , that the motion of a Sperm Whale ’ s flukes above water <unk> a <unk> , as when a <unk> lady <unk> her dress in a warm parlor .
What then shall I <unk> the Sperm Whale to for <unk> , considering his magnitude ?
<unk> it not be to that famous elephant , with <unk> tusks , and <unk> with <unk> , which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to <unk> the Great ?
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman , that a most significant event befell the most <unk> of the Pequod ’ s crew ; an event most <unk> ; and which ended in providing the sometimes <unk> merry and <unk> craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered <unk> might prove her own .
Now , in the whale ship , it is not every one that goes in the boats .
Some few hands are reserved called <unk> , whose <unk> it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale .
As a general thing , these <unk> are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats ’ crews .
But if there happen to be an <unk> slender , clumsy , or <unk> wight in the ship , that wight is certain to be made a <unk> .
It was so in the Pequod with the little negro <unk> by <unk> , Pip by <unk> .
Poor Pip !
ye have heard of him before ; ye must remember his tambourine on that <unk> midnight , so <unk> .
In outer aspect , Pip and Dough-Boy made a match , like a black <unk> and a white one , of equal <unk> , though of <unk> colour , driven in one <unk> <unk> .
But while <unk> Dough-Boy was by nature dull and <unk> in his <unk> , Pip , though over <unk> , was at bottom very bright , with that pleasant , genial , jolly <unk> peculiar to his tribe ; a tribe , which ever enjoy all <unk> and <unk> with <unk> , <unk> <unk> than any other race .
For <unk> , the year ’ s <unk> should show naught but three hundred and <unk> <unk> of <unk> and New <unk> ’ s <unk> .
Nor smile so , while I write that this little black was <unk> , for even blackness has its <unk> ; behold yon <unk> <unk> , <unk> in king ’ s <unk> .
But Pip <unk> life , and all life ’ s peaceable <unk> ; so that the <unk> business in which he had somehow <unk> become <unk> , had most sadly <unk> his <unk> ; though , as ere long will be seen , what was thus temporarily <unk> in him , in the end was destined to be <unk> <unk> by strange wild fires , that <unk> showed him off to ten times the natural <unk> with which in his native <unk> <unk> in <unk> , he had once <unk> many a <unk> ’ s <unk> on the green ; and at <unk> <unk> , with his gay <unk> !
had turned the round horizon into one <unk> tambourine .
So , though in the clear air of day , suspended against a <unk> neck , the <unk> <unk> drop will <unk> <unk> ; yet , when the cunning <unk> would show you the <unk> in its most <unk> <unk> , he lays it against a gloomy ground , and then lights it up , not by the sun , but by some unnatural <unk> .
Then come out those fiery <unk> , <unk> <unk> ; then the <unk> <unk> , once the <unk> symbol of the crystal skies , looks like some <unk> <unk> from the King of <unk> .
But let us to the story .
It came to pass , that in the ambergris affair Stubb ’ s <unk> chanced so to <unk> his hand , as for a time to become quite <unk> ; and , temporarily , Pip was put into his place .
The first time Stubb lowered with him , Pip evinced much <unk> ; but happily , for that time , escaped close contact with the whale ; and therefore came off not altogether <unk> ; though Stubb observing him , took care , afterwards , to <unk> him to cherish his <unk> to the utmost , for he might often find it <unk> .
Now upon the second lowering , the boat <unk> upon the whale ; and as the fish received the darted iron , it gave its customary <unk> , which happened , in this instance , to be right under poor Pip ’ s seat .
The <unk> consternation of the moment caused him to leap , <unk> in hand , out of the boat ; and in such a way , that part of the <unk> whale line coming against his chest , he <unk> it overboard with him , so as to become entangled in it , when at last <unk> into the water .
That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run , the line swiftly straightened ; and <unk> !
poor Pip came all <unk> up to the chocks of the boat , <unk> dragged there by the line , which had taken several turns around his chest and neck .
Tashtego stood in the bows .
He was full of the fire of the hunt .
He hated Pip for a <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from its <unk> , he suspended its sharp edge over the line , and turning towards Stubb , exclaimed <unk> , “ <unk> ? ” Meantime Pip ’ s blue , <unk> face plainly looked , Do , for God ’ s sake !
All passed in a flash .
In less than half a minute , this entire thing happened .
“ Damn him , cut ! ” roared Stubb ; and so the whale was lost and Pip was saved .
So soon as he recovered himself , the poor little negro was <unk> by <unk> and <unk> from the crew .
<unk> <unk> these irregular <unk> to <unk> , Stubb then in a plain , <unk> , but still half humorous manner , cursed Pip <unk> ; and that done , <unk> gave him much <unk> advice .
The substance was , Never jump from a boat , Pip , except — but all the rest was indefinite , as the <unk> advice ever is .
Now , in general , _ <unk> to the boat _ , is your true <unk> in whaling ; but cases will sometimes happen when _ <unk> from the boat _ , is still better .
Moreover , as if <unk> at last that if he should give <unk> conscientious advice to Pip , he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future ; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice , and concluded with a <unk> command , “ <unk> to the boat , Pip , or by the Lord , I won ’ t pick you up if you jump ; mind that .
We can ’ t afford to lose whales by the <unk> of you ; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would , Pip , in Alabama .
Bear that in mind , and don ’ t jump any more . ” <unk> perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted , that though man <unk> his fellow , yet man is a <unk> animal , which <unk> too often <unk> with his <unk> .
But we are all in the hands of the <unk> ; and Pip jumped again .
It was under very similar circumstances to the first <unk> ; but this time he did not breast out the line ; and hence , when the whale started to run , Pip was left behind on the sea , like a hurried traveller ’ s trunk .
<unk> !
Stubb was but too true to his word .
It was a beautiful , <unk> , blue day ; the <unk> sea calm and cool , and <unk> stretching away , all round , to the horizon , like <unk> ’ s skin hammered out to the <unk> .
<unk> up and down in that sea , Pip ’ s <unk> head showed like a head of <unk> .
No <unk> was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern .
Stubb ’ s <unk> back was turned upon him ; and the whale was <unk> .
In three minutes , a whole mile of <unk> ocean was between Pip and Stubb .
Out from the centre of the sea , poor Pip turned his <unk> , curling , black head to the sun , another lonely <unk> , though the <unk> and the <unk> .
Now , in calm weather , to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the <unk> <unk> as to <unk> in a <unk> ashore .
But the awful <unk> is intolerable .
The intense <unk> of self in the middle of such a <unk> <unk> , my God !
who can tell it ?
Mark , how when sailors in a dead calm <unk> in the open sea — mark how closely they <unk> their ship and only coast along her sides .
But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate ?
No ; he did not mean to , at least .
Because there were two boats in his wake , and he supposed , no doubt , that they would of course come up to Pip very quickly , and pick him up ; though , indeed , such considerations towards oarsmen <unk> through their own <unk> , is not always <unk> by the hunters in all similar instances ; and such instances not <unk> occur ; almost invariably in the fishery , a coward , so called , is marked with the same <unk> <unk> peculiar to military navies and <unk> .
But it so happened , that those boats , without seeing Pip , suddenly <unk> whales close to them on one side , turned , and gave chase ; and Stubb ’ s boat was now so far away , and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish , that Pip ’ s <unk> horizon began to expand around him <unk> .
By the <unk> chance the ship itself at last <unk> him ; but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an <unk> ; such , at least , they said he was .
The sea had <unk> kept his <unk> body up , but drowned the infinite of his soul .
Not drowned entirely , though .
Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths , where strange <unk> of the <unk> primal world glided to and fro before his <unk> eyes ; and the <unk> , <unk> , revealed his <unk> heaps ; and among the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Pip saw the <unk> , <unk> , coral <unk> , that out of the <unk> of waters heaved the colossal <unk> .
He saw God ’ s foot upon the <unk> of the loom , and spoke it ; and therefore his shipmates called him mad .
So man ’ s insanity is heaven ’ s sense ; and <unk> from all mortal reason , man comes at last to that celestial thought , which , to reason , is <unk> and frantic ; and <unk> or woe , feels then <unk> , indifferent as his God .
For the rest , <unk> not Stubb too hardly .
The thing is common in that fishery ; and in the <unk> of the narrative , it will then be seen what like <unk> befell myself .
CHAPTER <unk> .
A <unk> of the Hand .
That whale of Stubb ’ s , so <unk> <unk> , was duly brought to the Pequod ’ s side , where all those cutting and hoisting <unk> previously <unk> , were regularly gone through , even to the <unk> of the Heidelburgh Tun , or <unk> .
While some were occupied with this latter duty , others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs , so soon as filled with the sperm ; and when the proper time arrived , this same sperm was carefully <unk> ere going to the try-works , of which anon .
It had <unk> and <unk> to such a degree , that when , with several others , I sat down before a large <unk> ’ s <unk> of it , I found it strangely <unk> into <unk> , here and there rolling about in the <unk> part .
It was our business to squeeze these <unk> back into fluid .
A sweet and unctuous duty !
No wonder that in old times this sperm was such a favourite <unk> .
Such a <unk> !
such a <unk> !
such a <unk> !
such a <unk> <unk> !
After having my hands in it for only a few minutes , my fingers felt like <unk> , and began , as it were , to <unk> and <unk> .
As I sat there at my ease , <unk> on the deck ; after the bitter <unk> at the windlass ; under a blue <unk> sky ; the ship under indolent sail , and gliding so <unk> along ; as I <unk> my hands among those soft , gentle <unk> of <unk> <unk> , woven almost within the hour ; as they <unk> broke to my fingers , and <unk> all their <unk> , like fully ripe <unk> their wine ; as I snuffed up that <unk> <unk> , — literally and truly , like the smell of spring <unk> ; I declare to you , that for the time I lived as in a <unk> meadow ; I <unk> all about our horrible oath ; in that <unk> sperm , I washed my hands and my heart of it ; I almost began to credit the old <unk> superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in <unk> the heat of <unk> ; while <unk> in that <unk> , I felt <unk> free from all <unk> , or <unk> , or malice , of any sort whatsoever .
<unk> !
squeeze !
squeeze !
all the morning long ; I <unk> that sperm till I myself almost melted into it ; I <unk> that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me ; and I found myself <unk> <unk> my <unk> ’ hands in it , <unk> their hands for the gentle <unk> .
Such an abounding , affectionate , friendly , loving feeling did this <unk> beget ; that at last I was continually <unk> their hands , and looking up into their eyes <unk> ; as much as to say , — Oh !
my dear fellow beings , why should we longer cherish any social <unk> , or know the slightest <unk> or <unk> !
Come ; let us squeeze hands all round ; nay , let us all squeeze ourselves into each other ; let us squeeze ourselves <unk> into the very milk and sperm of <unk> .
Would that I could keep <unk> that sperm for ever !
For now , since by many prolonged , repeated experiences , I have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower , or at least <unk> , his conceit of <unk> <unk> ; not placing it anywhere in the <unk> or the fancy ; but in the wife , the heart , the bed , the table , the <unk> , the fireside , the country ; now that I have perceived all this , I am ready to squeeze case eternally .
In thoughts of the <unk> of the night , I saw long rows of angels in <unk> , each with his hands in a <unk> of spermaceti .
Now , while <unk> of sperm , it <unk> to speak of other things <unk> to it , in the business of <unk> the sperm whale for the try-works .
First comes <unk> , so called , which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish , and also from the <unk> <unk> of his flukes .
It is tough with <unk> tendons — a wad of <unk> — but still contains some oil .
After being <unk> from the whale , the <unk> is first cut into <unk> <unk> ere going to the mincer .
They look much like blocks of <unk> marble .
<unk> is the term bestowed upon certain <unk> parts of the whale ’ s flesh , here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber , and often <unk> to a considerable degree in its <unk> .
It is a most <unk> , convivial , beautiful object to behold .
As its name <unk> , it is of an exceedingly rich , <unk> <unk> , with a <unk> snowy and golden ground , dotted with <unk> of the deepest <unk> and purple .
It is <unk> of <unk> , in pictures of <unk> .
<unk> of reason , it is hard to keep yourself from eating it .
I confess , that once I stole behind the <unk> to try it .
It <unk> something as I should <unk> a royal <unk> from the thigh of Louis <unk> <unk> might have <unk> , <unk> him to have been killed the first day after the <unk> season , and that particular <unk> season <unk> with an unusually fine <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
There is another substance , and a very singular one , which turns up in the course of this business , but which I feel it to be very <unk> adequately to <unk> .
It is called <unk> ; an <unk> original with the whalemen , and even so is the nature of the substance .
It is an <unk> <unk> , <unk> affair , most frequently found in the tubs of sperm , after a prolonged <unk> , and subsequent <unk> .
I hold it to be the <unk> thin , <unk> <unk> of the case , <unk> .
<unk> , so called , is a term properly belonging to right whalemen , but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen .
It <unk> the dark , <unk> substance which is <unk> off the back of the Greenland or right whale , and much of which <unk> the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that <unk> Leviathan .
<unk> .
<unk> this word is not <unk> to the whale ’ s <unk> .
But as applied by whalemen , it becomes so .
A whaleman ’ s <unk> is a short firm strip of <unk> stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan ’ s tail : it <unk> an inch in thickness , and for the rest , is about the size of the iron part of a <unk> .
<unk> moved along the oily deck , it <unk> like a leathern <unk> ; and by nameless <unk> , as of magic , <unk> along with it all <unk> .
But to learn all about these <unk> matters , your best way is at once to descend into the <unk> , and have a long talk with its <unk> .
This place has previously been mentioned as the <unk> for the <unk> , when <unk> and hoisted from the whale .
When the proper time <unk> for cutting up its contents , this apartment is a scene of terror to all <unk> , especially by night .
On one side , <unk> by a dull lantern , a space has been left clear for the <unk> .
They generally go in <unk> , — a <unk> and a <unk> .
The <unk> is similar to a frigate ’ s <unk> of the same name .
The <unk> is something like a <unk> .
With his <unk> , the <unk> hooks on to a sheet of blubber , and <unk> to hold it from slipping , as the ship <unk> and <unk> about .
Meanwhile , the <unk> stands on the sheet itself , perpendicularly <unk> it into the <unk> <unk> .
This spade is sharp as <unk> can make it ; the <unk> ’ s feet are <unk> ; the thing he stands on will sometimes <unk> slide away from him , like a <unk> .
If he <unk> off one of his own toes , or one of his <unk> ’ , would you be very much astonished ?
<unk> are scarce among veteran <unk> men .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this <unk> of the whale ; and had you <unk> forward nigh the windlass , pretty sure am I that you would have <unk> with no small curiosity a very strange , <unk> object , which you would have seen there , lying along lengthwise in the lee <unk> .
Not the wondrous <unk> in the whale ’ s huge head ; not the <unk> of his <unk> lower jaw ; not the <unk> of his <unk> tail ; none of these would so surprise you , as half a glimpse of that unaccountable <unk> , — longer than a <unk> is tall , nigh a foot in <unk> at the base , and <unk> as Yojo , the <unk> idol of Queequeg .
And an idol , indeed , it is ; or , rather , in old times , its likeness was .
Such an idol as that found in the secret groves of Queen <unk> in <unk> ; and for worshipping which , King <unk> , her son , did <unk> her , and destroyed the idol , and burnt it for an <unk> at the <unk> <unk> , as <unk> set forth in the <unk> chapter of the First Book of Kings .
Look at the sailor , called the mincer , who now comes along , and <unk> by two <unk> , heavily backs the <unk> , as the mariners call it , and with bowed shoulders , <unk> off with it as if he were a <unk> carrying a dead comrade from the field .
<unk> it upon the forecastle deck , he now proceeds <unk> to remove its dark <unk> , as an <unk> hunter the <unk> of a <unk> .
This done he turns the <unk> inside out , like a <unk> leg ; gives it a good stretching , so as almost to double its <unk> ; and at last hangs it , well spread , in the rigging , to dry .
Ere long , it is taken down ; when removing some three feet of it , towards the pointed extremity , and then cutting two <unk> for <unk> at the other end , he lengthwise <unk> himself bodily into it .
The mincer now stands before you invested in the full <unk> of his calling .
<unk> to all his order , this <unk> alone will adequately <unk> him , while employed in the peculiar <unk> of his office .
That office consists in <unk> the <unk> of blubber for the pots ; an operation which is <unk> at a curious wooden horse , planted <unk> against the bulwarks , and with a <unk> tub beneath it , into which the <unk> pieces drop , fast as the sheets from a <unk> <unk> ’ s desk .
<unk> in decent black ; <unk> a conspicuous pulpit ; intent on <unk> leaves ; what a <unk> for an <unk> , what a lad for a <unk> were this mincer !
* * Bible leaves !
Bible leaves !
This is the <unk> cry from the mates to the mincer .
It <unk> him to be careful , and cut his work into as thin <unk> as possible , inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much <unk> , and its quantity considerably increased , besides perhaps <unk> it in quality .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
Besides her hoisted boats , an American whaler is <unk> distinguished by her try-works .
She presents the curious <unk> of the most solid masonry <unk> with oak and hemp in <unk> the completed ship .
It is as if from the open field a <unk> were <unk> to her planks .
The try-works are planted between the <unk> and mainmast , the most <unk> part of the deck .
The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength , fitted to <unk> the weight of an almost solid mass of <unk> and <unk> , some ten feet by eight square , and five in height .
The <unk> does not <unk> the deck , but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides , and <unk> it down to the timbers .
On the flanks it is <unk> with wood , and at top completely covered by a large , <unk> , <unk> hatchway .
<unk> this hatch we expose the great <unk> , two in number , and each of several barrels ’ <unk> .
When not in use , they are kept <unk> clean .
Sometimes they are polished with <unk> and sand , till they <unk> within like silver <unk> .
During the <unk> some <unk> old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap .
While employed in <unk> them — one man in each <unk> , side by side — many confidential <unk> are carried on , over the iron lips .
It is a place also for profound <unk> meditation .
It was in the left hand <unk> of the Pequod , with the <unk> diligently <unk> round me , that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact , that in <unk> all bodies gliding along the <unk> , my <unk> for example , will descend from any point in precisely the same time .
<unk> the <unk> from the front of the try-works , the bare masonry of that side is exposed , <unk> by the two iron mouths of the <unk> , directly <unk> the pots .
These mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron .
The intense heat of the fire is <unk> from <unk> itself to the deck , by means of a <unk> <unk> extending under the entire <unk> surface of the works .
By a <unk> inserted at the rear , this <unk> is kept replenished with water as fast as it <unk> .
There are no external <unk> ; they open direct from the rear wall .
And here let us go back for a moment .
It was about nine o ’ clock at night that the Pequod ’ s try-works were first started on this present voyage .
It belonged to Stubb to <unk> the business .
“ All ready there ?
<unk> hatch , then , and start her .
You cook , fire the works . ” This was an easy thing , for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the <unk> throughout the passage .
Here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be <unk> for a time with wood .
After that no wood is used , except as a means of quick <unk> to the <unk> fuel .
In a word , after being tried out , the <unk> , <unk> blubber , now called <unk> or <unk> , still contains considerable of its unctuous <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> the flames .
Like a <unk> burning <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> , once <unk> , the whale <unk> his own fuel and burns by his own body .
Would that he consumed his own smoke !
for his smoke is horrible to <unk> , and <unk> it you must , and not only that , but you must live in it for the time .
It has an unspeakable , wild , Hindoo odor about it , such as may lurk in the vicinity of <unk> <unk> .
It smells like the left wing of the day of judgment ; it is an argument for the pit .
By midnight the works were in full operation .
We were clear from the carcase ; sail had been made ; the wind was <unk> ; the wild ocean darkness was intense .
But that darkness was <unk> up by the fierce flames , which at intervals forked forth from the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> every lofty rope in the rigging , as with the <unk> Greek fire .
The burning ship <unk> on , as if <unk> <unk> to some vengeful deed .
So the pitch and <unk> <unk> of the bold <unk> , <unk> , <unk> from their midnight harbors , with broad sheets of flame for sails , bore down upon the Turkish <unk> , and folded them in <unk> .
The hatch , removed from the top of the works , now afforded a wide hearth in front of them .
Standing on this were the <unk> <unk> of the pagan harpooneers , always the whale-ship ’ s <unk> .
With huge <unk> poles they pitched <unk> masses of blubber into the scalding pots , or stirred up the fires beneath , till the <unk> flames darted , curling , out of the doors to catch them by the feet .
The smoke rolled away in sullen heaps .
To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil , which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces .
<unk> the mouth of the works , on the further side of the wide wooden hearth , was the windlass .
This served for a <unk> .
Here <unk> the watch , when not otherwise employed , looking into the red heat of the fire , till their eyes felt scorched in their heads .
Their tawny features , now all <unk> with smoke and <unk> , their <unk> <unk> , and the contrasting barbaric <unk> of their teeth , all these were strangely revealed in the <unk> <unk> of the works .
As they narrated to each other their <unk> adventures , their tales of terror told in words of <unk> ; as their <unk> <unk> forked upwards out of them , like the flames from the <unk> ; as to and fro , in their front , the harpooneers wildly <unk> with their huge <unk> <unk> and <unk> ; as the wind howled on , and the sea leaped , and the ship <unk> and dived , and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night , and <unk> <unk> the white bone in her mouth , and <unk> <unk> round her on all sides ; then the rushing Pequod , <unk> with savages , and laden with fire , and burning a corpse , and plunging into that blackness of darkness , seemed the material <unk> of her monomaniac commander ’ s soul .
So seemed it to me , as I stood at her helm , and for long hours silently <unk> the way of this <unk> on the sea .
<unk> , for that interval , in darkness myself , I but the better saw the <unk> , the madness , the <unk> of others .
The continual sight of the fiend <unk> before me , <unk> half in smoke and half in fire , these at last <unk> kindred <unk> in my soul , so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable <unk> which ever would come over me at a midnight helm .
But that night , in particular , a strange ( and ever since inexplicable ) thing occurred to me .
<unk> from a brief standing sleep , I was <unk> conscious of something <unk> wrong .
The <unk> tiller smote my side , which leaned against it ; in my ears was the low hum of sails , just beginning to shake in the wind ; I thought my eyes were open ; I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the <unk> and mechanically stretching them still further apart .
But , spite of all this , I could see no compass before me to steer by ; though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the <unk> , by the steady binnacle lamp <unk> it .
Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom , now and then made ghastly by flashes of <unk> .
<unk> was the impression , that whatever swift , rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all <unk> astern .
A stark , <unk> feeling , as of death , came over me .
<unk> my hands grasped the tiller , but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was , somehow , in some enchanted way , inverted .
My God !
what is the matter with me ?
thought I.
<unk> !
in my brief sleep I had turned myself about , and was <unk> the ship ’ s stern , with my back to her prow and the compass .
In an instant I <unk> back , just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind , and very probably <unk> her .
How glad and how <unk> the relief from this unnatural <unk> of the night , and the fatal <unk> of being brought by the lee !
Look not too long in the face of the fire , O man !
Never dream with thy hand on the helm !
Turn not thy back to the compass ; <unk> the first hint of the <unk> tiller ; believe not the artificial fire , when its <unk> makes all things look ghastly .
<unk> , in the natural sun , the skies will be bright ; those who <unk> like devils in the <unk> flames , the <unk> will show in far other , at least <unk> , relief ; the glorious , golden , glad sun , the only true lamp — all others but <unk> !
Nevertheless the sun <unk> not Virginia ’ s <unk> <unk> , nor Rome ’ s accursed <unk> , nor wide <unk> , nor all the millions of miles of <unk> and of <unk> beneath the moon .
The sun <unk> not the ocean , which is the dark side of this earth , and which is two thirds of this earth .
So , therefore , that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him , that mortal man cannot be true — not true , or <unk> .
With books the same .
The <unk> of all men was the Man of <unk> , and the <unk> of all books is Solomon ’ s , and <unk> is the fine hammered steel of woe .
“ All is <unk> . ” <unk> .
This wilful world hath not got hold of <unk> Solomon ’ s wisdom yet .
But he who <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> fast crossing <unk> , and would rather talk of <unk> than hell ; calls <unk> , Young , <unk> , <unk> , poor devils all of sick men ; and throughout a <unk> lifetime <unk> by <unk> as passing wise , and therefore jolly ; — not that man is fitted to sit down on <unk> , and break the green damp mould with <unk> wondrous Solomon .
But even Solomon , he says , “ the man that <unk> out of the way of understanding shall remain ” ( _ <unk> _ , even while living ) “ in the congregation of the dead . ” Give not thyself up , then , to fire , lest it <unk> thee , <unk> thee ; as for the time it did me .
There is a wisdom that is woe ; but there is a woe that is madness .
And there is a <unk> eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces .
And even if he for ever flies within the <unk> , that <unk> is in the mountains ; so that even in his <unk> <unk> the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain , even though they <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
Had you descended from the Pequod ’ s try-works to the Pequod ’ s forecastle , where the off duty watch were sleeping , for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some <unk> <unk> of <unk> kings and <unk> .
There they lay in their triangular oaken <unk> , each mariner a <unk> <unk> ; a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes .
In <unk> , oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens .
To dress in the dark , and eat in the dark , and <unk> in darkness to his <unk> , this is his usual lot .
But the whaleman , as he seeks the food of light , so he lives in light .
He makes his berth an <unk> ’ s lamp , and lays him down in it ; so that in the <unk> night the ship ’ s black hull still houses an <unk> .
See with what entire <unk> the whaleman takes his handful of lamps — often but old <unk> and <unk> , though — to the copper <unk> at the try-works , and <unk> them there , as <unk> of ale at a <unk> .
He burns , too , the <unk> of oil , in its <unk> , and , therefore , <unk> state ; a fluid unknown to <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> contrivances ashore .
It is sweet as early grass butter in <unk> .
He goes and <unk> for his oil , so as to be sure of its <unk> and <unk> , even as the traveller on the prairie <unk> up his own supper of game .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> Down and <unk> Up .
Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried from the mast-head ; how he is chased over the watery <unk> , and <unk> in the valleys of the deep ; how he is then towed alongside and beheaded ; and how ( on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to the <unk> in which the beheaded was killed ) his great <unk> <unk> becomes the property of his <unk> ; how , in due time , he is condemned to the pots , and , like <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , his spermaceti , oil , and bone pass <unk> through the fire ; — but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by <unk> — singing , if I may — the romantic proceeding of <unk> off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold , where once again leviathan <unk> to his native <unk> , sliding along beneath the surface as before ; but , alas !
never more to rise and blow .
While still warm , the oil , like hot punch , is received into the <unk> casks ; and while , perhaps , the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea , the enormous casks are <unk> round and headed over , end for end , and sometimes <unk> <unk> across the slippery deck , like so many land <unk> , till at last <unk> and stayed in their course ; and all round the hoops , <unk> , <unk> , go as many hammers as can play upon them , for now , _ <unk> <unk> _ , every sailor is a cooper .
At length , when the last <unk> is <unk> , and all is cool , then the great <unk> are <unk> , the bowels of the ship are thrown open , and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea .
This done , the hatches are <unk> , and <unk> closed , like a <unk> <unk> up .
In the sperm fishery , this is perhaps one of the most remarkable <unk> in all the business of whaling .
One day the planks stream with <unk> of blood and oil ; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of the whale ’ s head are <unk> piled ; great <unk> casks lie about , as in a <unk> yard ; the smoke from the try-works has <unk> all the bulwarks ; the mariners go about <unk> with <unk> ; the entire ship seems great leviathan himself ; while on all hands the din is <unk> .
But a day or two after , you look about you , and prick your ears in this <unk> ship ; and were it not for the <unk> boats and try-works , you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel , with a most <unk> <unk> commander .
The <unk> sperm oil <unk> a singularly <unk> virtue .
This is the reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil .
Besides , from the ashes of the burned <unk> of the whale , a potent <unk> is readily made ; and whenever any <unk> from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side , that <unk> quickly <unk> it .
Hands go diligently along the bulwarks , and with <unk> of water and <unk> <unk> them to their full <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> from the lower rigging .
All the numerous <unk> which have been in use are likewise <unk> <unk> and put away .
The great hatch is <unk> and placed upon the try-works , completely <unk> the pots ; every cask is out of sight ; all tackles are coiled in unseen <unk> ; and when by the combined and <unk> <unk> of almost the entire ship ’ s company , the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded , then the crew themselves proceed to their own <unk> ; <unk> themselves from top to <unk> ; and finally <unk> to the <unk> deck , fresh and all <unk> , as <unk> <unk> from out the <unk> Holland .
Now , with <unk> step , they pace the planks in <unk> and <unk> , and humorously <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and fine <unk> ; propose to mat the deck ; think of having hanging to the top ; object not to taking tea by moonlight on the <unk> of the forecastle .
To hint to such <unk> mariners of oil , and bone , and blubber , were little short of <unk> .
They know not the thing you <unk> <unk> to .
Away , and bring us <unk> !
But mark : aloft there , at the three mast heads , stand three men intent on <unk> out more whales , which , if caught , infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture , and drop at least one small <unk> somewhere .
Yes ; and many is the time , when , after the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which know no night ; <unk> straight through for <unk> hours ; when from the boat , where they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line , — they only step to the deck to carry vast chains , and heave the heavy windlass , and cut and <unk> , yea , and in their very <unk> to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works ; when , on the heel of all this , they have finally <unk> themselves to <unk> the ship , and make a <unk> <unk> room of it ; many is the time the poor fellows , just <unk> the <unk> of their clean <unk> , are startled by the cry of “ There she blows ! ” and away they fly to fight another whale , and go through the whole weary thing again .
Oh !
my friends , but this is <unk> !
Yet this is life .
For hardly have we mortals by long <unk> extracted from this world ’ s vast bulk its small but valuable sperm ; and then , with weary <unk> , <unk> ourselves from its <unk> , and learned to live here in clean <unk> of the soul ; hardly is this done , when — _ There she blows ! _ — the ghost is spouted up , and away we sail to fight some other world , and go through young life ’ s old <unk> again .
Oh !
the <unk> !
Oh !
<unk> , that in bright <unk> , two thousand years ago , did die , so good , so wise , so mild ; I sailed with thee along the <unk> coast last voyage — and , foolish as I am , <unk> thee , a green simple boy , how to splice a rope !
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Doubloon .
Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck , taking regular turns at either limit , the binnacle and mainmast ; but in the <unk> of other things <unk> <unk> it has not been added how that sometimes in these <unk> , when most plunged in his mood , he was wont to pause in turn at each spot , and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him .
When he <unk> before the binnacle , with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass , that glance shot like a <unk> with the pointed intensity of his purpose ; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast , then , as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there , he still wore the same aspect of nailed <unk> , only dashed with a certain wild <unk> , if not <unk> .
But one morning , turning to pass the doubloon , he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and <unk> <unk> on it , as though now for the first time beginning to <unk> for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them .
And some certain significance lurks in all things , else all things are little worth , and the round world itself but an empty <unk> , except to sell by the <unk> , as they do hills about <unk> , to fill up some <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Now this doubloon was of <unk> , virgin gold , <unk> somewhere out of the heart of <unk> hills , whence , east and west , over golden <unk> , the <unk> of many a <unk> <unk> .
And though now nailed <unk> all the <unk> of iron bolts and the <unk> of copper <unk> , yet , <unk> and <unk> to any <unk> , it still preserved its <unk> <unk> .
Nor , though placed <unk> a <unk> crew and every hour passed by <unk> hands , and through the <unk> nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any <unk> approach , nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last .
For it was set apart and <unk> to one <unk> end ; and however <unk> in their sailor ways , one and all , the mariners <unk> it as the white whale ’ s <unk> .
Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night , wondering whose it was to be at last , and whether he would ever live to spend it .
Now those noble golden coins of South America are as <unk> of the sun and tropic <unk> .
Here palms , <unk> , and <unk> ; sun ’ s <unk> and stars ; <unk> , <unk> , and rich <unk> waving , are in <unk> <unk> <unk> ; so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added <unk> and <unk> <unk> , by passing through those fancy <unk> , so <unk> <unk> .
It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most <unk> example of these things .
On its round <unk> it bore the letters , <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> .
So this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world , and beneath the great equator , and named after it ; and it had been cast midway up the Andes , in the <unk> <unk> that knows no <unk> .
<unk> by those letters you saw the likeness of three Andes ’ <unk> ; from one a flame ; a tower on another ; on the third a <unk> cock ; while <unk> over all was a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the signs all marked with their usual <unk> , and the <unk> sun entering the <unk> point at <unk> .
<unk> this equatorial coin , Ahab , not <unk> by others , was now pausing .
“ There ’ s something ever <unk> in <unk> and <unk> , and all other grand and lofty things ; look here , — three <unk> as proud as <unk> .
The firm tower , that is Ahab ; the <unk> , that is Ahab ; the <unk> , the <unk> , and <unk> fowl , that , too , is Ahab ; all are Ahab ; and this round gold is but the image of the <unk> globe , which , like a <unk> ’ s glass , to each and every man in turn but <unk> back his own mysterious self .
Great pains , small <unk> for those who ask the world to <unk> them ; it cannot <unk> itself .
Methinks now this <unk> sun wears a <unk> face ; but see !
aye , he enters the sign of storms , the <unk> !
and but six months before he <unk> out of a former <unk> at <unk> !
From storm to storm !
So be it , then .
<unk> in <unk> , ’ tis fit that man should live in pains and die in <unk> !
So be it , then !
Here ’ s stout stuff for woe to work on .
So be it , then . ” “ No <unk> fingers can have pressed the gold , but devil ’ s <unk> must have left their <unk> there since yesterday , ” murmured Starbuck to himself , leaning against the bulwarks .
“ The old man seems to read Belshazzar ’ s awful writing .
I have never marked the coin <unk> .
He goes below ; let me read .
A dark valley between three mighty , <unk> <unk> , that almost seem the <unk> , in some faint earthly symbol .
So in this <unk> of Death , God <unk> us round ; and over all our gloom , the sun of <unk> still <unk> a <unk> and a hope .
If we bend down our eyes , the dark <unk> shows her mouldy soil ; but if we lift them , the bright sun <unk> our glance half way , to cheer .
Yet , oh , the great sun is no <unk> ; and if , at midnight , we would fain <unk> some sweet <unk> from him , we gaze for him in vain !
This coin <unk> <unk> , mildly , truly , but still sadly to me .
I will quit it , lest Truth shake me <unk> . ” “ There now ’ s the old Mogul , ” soliloquized Stubb by the try-works , “ he ’ s been <unk> it ; and there goes Starbuck from the same , and both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long .
And all from looking at a piece of gold , which did I have it now on <unk> <unk> or in <unk> ’ s <unk> , I ’ d not look at it very long ere spending it .
<unk> !
in my poor , <unk> opinion , I regard this as queer .
I have seen doubloons before now in my <unk> ; your doubloons of old Spain , your doubloons of Peru , your doubloons of <unk> , your doubloons of <unk> , your doubloons of <unk> ; with plenty of gold <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and half <unk> , and quarter <unk> .
What then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so <unk> wonderful ?
By <unk> !
let me read it once .
Halloa !
here ’ s signs and wonders truly !
That , now , is what old <unk> in his <unk> calls the <unk> , and what my <unk> below calls <unk> .
I ’ ll get the <unk> and as I have heard devils can be raised with <unk> ’ s <unk> , I ’ ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer <unk> here with the <unk> <unk> .
Here ’ s the book .
Let ’ s see now .
<unk> and wonders ; and the sun , he ’ s always among ’ em .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ; here they are — here they go — all alive : — <unk> , or the <unk> ; <unk> , or the <unk> and <unk> !
here ’ s <unk> himself , or the <unk> .
Well ; the sun he <unk> among ’ em .
Aye , here on the coin he ’ s just crossing the threshold between two of twelve <unk> all in a ring .
Book !
you lie there ; the fact is , you books must know your places .
You ’ ll do to give us the bare words and facts , but we come in to supply the thoughts .
That ’ s my small experience , so far as the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> ’ s <unk> , and <unk> ’ s <unk> go .
<unk> and wonders , eh ?
<unk> if there is nothing wonderful in signs , and significant in wonders !
There ’ s a <unk> somewhere ; wait a bit ; <unk> — <unk> !
By Jove , I have it !
Look you , Doubloon , your <unk> here is the life of man in one round chapter ; and now I ’ ll read it off , straight out of the book .
Come , <unk> !
To begin : there ’ s <unk> , or the <unk> — <unk> dog , he <unk> us ; then , <unk> , or the <unk> — he <unk> us the first thing ; then <unk> , or the <unk> — that is , Virtue and <unk> ; we try to reach Virtue , when lo !
comes <unk> the <unk> , and drags us back ; and here , going from Virtue , <unk> , a roaring <unk> , lies in the path — he gives a few fierce <unk> and <unk> <unk> with his <unk> ; we escape , and hail <unk> , the Virgin !
that ’ s our first love ; we <unk> and think to be happy for aye , when <unk> comes <unk> , or the <unk> — <unk> <unk> and found wanting ; and while we are very sad about that , Lord !
how we suddenly jump , as <unk> , or the <unk> , <unk> us in the rear ; we are <unk> the wound , when <unk> come the <unk> all round ; <unk> , or the <unk> , is <unk> himself .
As we <unk> out the <unk> , stand aside !
here ’ s the <unk> , <unk> , or the <unk> ; full <unk> , he comes rushing , and headlong we are tossed ; when <unk> , or the <unk> , <unk> out his whole <unk> and <unk> us ; and to wind up with <unk> , or the <unk> , we sleep .
There ’ s a <unk> now , <unk> in high heaven , and the sun goes through it every year , and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty .
<unk> he , aloft there , <unk> through toil and trouble ; and so , <unk> here , does jolly Stubb .
Oh , jolly ’ s the word for aye !
<unk> , Doubloon !
But stop ; here comes little King-Post ; <unk> round the try-works , now , and let ’ s hear what he ’ ll have to say .
There ; he ’ s before it ; he ’ ll out with something presently .
So , so ; he ’ s beginning . ” “ I see nothing here , but a round thing made of gold , and whoever raises a certain whale , this round thing belongs to him .
So , what ’ s all this staring been about ?
It is worth sixteen dollars , that ’ s true ; and at two <unk> the <unk> , that ’ s nine hundred and sixty <unk> .
I won ’ t smoke <unk> pipes like Stubb , but I like <unk> , and here ’ s nine hundred and sixty of them ; so here goes Flask aloft to <unk> ’ em out . ” “ Shall I call that wise or foolish , now ; if it be really wise it has a foolish look to it ; yet , if it be really foolish , then has it a sort of <unk> look to it .
But , avast ; here comes our old Manxman — the old <unk> , he must have been , that is , before he took to the sea .
He <unk> up before the doubloon ; <unk> , and goes round on the other side of the mast ; why , there ’ s a <unk> nailed on that side ; and now he ’ s back again ; what does that mean ?
Hark !
he ’ s muttering — voice like an old <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ears , and listen ! ” “ If the White Whale be raised , it must be in a month and a day , when the sun stands in some one of these signs .
I ’ ve <unk> signs , and know their marks ; they were <unk> me two score years ago , by the old <unk> in <unk> .
Now , in what sign will the sun then be ?
The <unk> sign ; for there it is , right opposite the gold .
And what ’ s the <unk> sign ?
The <unk> is the <unk> sign — the roaring and <unk> <unk> .
Ship , old ship !
my old head shakes to think of thee . ” “ There ’ s another <unk> now ; but still one text .
All sorts of men in one kind of world , you see .
<unk> again !
here comes Queequeg — all tattooing — looks like the signs of the <unk> himself .
What says the <unk> ?
As I live he ’ s <unk> <unk> ; looking at his thigh bone ; thinks the sun is in the thigh , or in the <unk> , or in the bowels , I suppose , as the old women talk <unk> ’ s <unk> in the back country .
And by Jove , he ’ s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh — I guess it ’ s <unk> , or the <unk> .
No : he don ’ t know what to make of the doubloon ; he takes it for an old <unk> off some king ’ s trowsers .
But , aside again !
here comes that <unk> , Fedallah ; tail coiled out of sight as usual , oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual .
What does he say , with that look of his ?
Ah , only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself ; there is a sun on the coin — fire <unk> , depend upon it .
Ho !
more and more .
This way comes Pip — poor boy !
would he had died , or I ; he ’ s half horrible to me .
He too has been watching all of these <unk> — myself included — and look now , he comes to read , with that unearthly <unk> face .
Stand away again and hear him .
Hark ! ” “ I look , you look , he looks ; we look , ye look , they look . ” “ Upon my soul , he ’ s been studying <unk> ’ s <unk> !
<unk> his mind , poor fellow !
But what ’ s that he says now — <unk> ! ” “ I look , you look , he looks ; we look , ye look , they look . ” “ Why , he ’ s getting it by heart — <unk> !
again . ” “ I look , you look , he looks ; we look , ye look , they look . ” “ Well , that ’ s funny . ” “ And I , you , and he ; and we , ye , and they , are all <unk> ; and I ’ m a crow , especially when I stand a ’ top of this pine tree here .
<unk> !
caw !
caw !
caw !
caw !
caw !
<unk> ’ t I a crow ?
And where ’ s the <unk> ?
There he stands ; two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers , and two more <unk> into the sleeves of an old jacket . ” “ <unk> if he means me ? — <unk> ! — poor lad ! — I could go hang myself .
Any way , for the present , I ’ ll quit Pip ’ s vicinity .
I can stand the rest , for they have plain <unk> ; but he ’ s too <unk> for my <unk> .
So , so , I leave him muttering . ” “ Here ’ s the ship ’ s <unk> , this doubloon here , and they are all on fire to <unk> it .
But , <unk> your <unk> , and what ’ s the consequence ?
Then again , if it <unk> here , that is <unk> , too , for when aught ’ s nailed to the mast it ’ s a sign that things grow desperate .
Ha , ha !
old Ahab !
the White Whale ; he ’ ll nail ye !
This is a pine tree .
My father , in old <unk> <unk> , cut down a pine tree once , and found a silver ring grown over in it ; some old <unk> ’ s wedding ring .
How did it get there ?
And so they ’ ll say in the resurrection , when they come to fish up this old mast , and find a doubloon lodged in it , with <unk> <unk> for the shaggy <unk> .
Oh , the gold !
the precious , precious , gold !
the green <unk> ’ ll <unk> ye soon !
<unk> !
<unk> !
God goes ’ <unk> the worlds <unk> .
Cook !
ho , cook !
and cook us !
<unk> !
hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , <unk> , <unk> !
and get your <unk> done ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
Leg and <unk> .
The Pequod , of Nantucket , Meets the Samuel Enderby , of London .
“ Ship , ahoy !
Hast seen the White Whale ? ” So cried Ahab , once more hailing a ship showing English colours , bearing down under the stern .
<unk> to mouth , the old man was standing in his hoisted <unk> , his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain , who was <unk> <unk> in his own boat ’ s bow .
He was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> man , of sixty or <unk> , dressed in a <unk> <unk> , that hung round him in <unk> of blue <unk> ; and one empty arm of this jacket <unk> behind him like the <unk> arm of a <unk> ’ s <unk> .
“ Hast seen the White Whale ? ” “ See you this ? ” and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it , he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone , <unk> in a wooden head like a <unk> .
“ Man my boat ! ” cried Ahab , <unk> , and tossing about the oars near him — “ Stand by to lower ! ” In less than a minute , without <unk> his little craft , he and his crew were dropped to the water , and were soon alongside of the stranger .
But here a curious difficulty presented itself .
In the excitement of the moment , Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own , and then it was always by an <unk> and very <unk> mechanical <unk> peculiar to the Pequod , and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment ’ s warning .
Now , it is no very easy matter for anybody — except those who are almost <unk> used to it , like whalemen — to <unk> up a ship ’ s side from a boat on the open sea ; for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks , and then <unk> drop it half way down to the <unk> .
So , <unk> of one leg , and the strange ship of course being altogether <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , Ahab now found himself <unk> <unk> to a clumsy landsman again ; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain <unk> height he could hardly hope to <unk> .
It has before been hinted , perhaps , that every little <unk> circumstance that befell him , and which indirectly sprang from his <unk> <unk> , almost invariably <unk> or exasperated Ahab .
And in the present instance , all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship , leaning over the side , by the perpendicular ladder of nailed <unk> there , and swinging towards him a pair of <unk> <unk> ; for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a <unk> man must be too much of a <unk> to use their sea <unk> .
But this <unk> only <unk> a minute , because the strange captain , observing at a glance how affairs stood , cried out , “ I see , I see ! — avast heaving there !
<unk> , boys , and swing over the <unk> . ” As good luck would have it , they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous , and the great tackles were still aloft , and the massive curved <unk> , now clean and dry , was still attached to the end .
This was quickly lowered to Ahab , who at once <unk> it all , slid his solitary thigh into the <unk> of the hook ( it was like sitting in the <unk> of an anchor , or the crotch of an <unk> tree ) , and then giving the word , held himself fast , and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight , by pulling <unk> upon one of the running parts of the tackle .
Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks , and gently landed upon the capstan head .
With his ivory arm <unk> thrust forth in welcome , the other captain advanced , and Ahab , putting out his ivory leg , and crossing the ivory arm ( like two sword-fish blades ) cried out in his walrus way , “ Aye , aye , hearty !
let us shake bones together ! — an arm and a leg ! — an arm that never can <unk> , d ’ ye see ; and a leg that never can run .
Where did ’ st thou see the White Whale ? — how long ago ? ” “ The White Whale , ” said the Englishman , pointing his ivory arm towards the East , and taking a <unk> sight along it , as if it had been a <unk> ; “ there I saw him , on the Line , last season . ” “ And he took that arm off , did he ? ” asked Ahab , now sliding down from the capstan , and resting on the Englishman ’ s shoulder , as he did so .
“ Aye , he was the cause of it , at least ; and that leg , too ? ” “ <unk> me the yarn , ” said Ahab ; “ how was it ? ” “ It was the first time in my life that I ever <unk> on the Line , ” began the Englishman .
“ I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time .
Well , one day we lowered for a <unk> of four or five whales , and my boat fastened to one of them ; a regular <unk> horse he was , too , that went <unk> and <unk> round so , that my boat ’ s crew could only <unk> dish , by sitting all their <unk> on the outer gunwale .
Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a <unk> great whale , with a <unk> head and hump , all <unk> ’ feet and wrinkles . ” “ It was he , it was he ! ” cried Ahab , suddenly <unk> out his suspended breath .
“ And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin . ” “ Aye , aye — they were mine — _ my _ irons , ” cried Ahab , <unk> — “ but on ! ” “ Give me a chance , then , ” said the Englishman , <unk> .
“ Well , this old <unk> , with the white head and hump , runs all <unk> into the <unk> , and goes to <unk> furiously at my <unk> !
“ Aye , I see ! — wanted to part it ; free the <unk> — an old trick — I know him . ” “ How it was exactly , ” continued the <unk> commander , “ I do not know ; but in biting the line , it got foul of his teeth , caught there somehow ; but we didn ’ t know it then ; so that when we afterwards pulled on the line , <unk> we came <unk> on to his hump !
instead of the other whale ’ s ; that went off to windward , all <unk> .
Seeing how matters stood , and what a noble great whale it was — the <unk> and <unk> I ever saw , sir , in my life — I resolved to capture him , spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in .
And thinking the <unk> line would get loose , or the tooth it was <unk> to might draw ( for I have a devil of a boat ’ s crew for a pull on a whale-line ) ; seeing all this , I say , I jumped into my first mate ’ s boat — Mr.
<unk> ’ s here ( by the way , Captain — <unk> ; <unk> — the captain ) ; — as I was saying , I jumped into <unk> ’ s boat , which , d ’ ye see , was gunwale and gunwale with mine , then ; and snatching the first harpoon , let this old <unk> have it .
But , Lord , look you , sir — hearts and souls alive , man — the next instant , in a <unk> , I was blind as a <unk> — both eyes out — all <unk> and <unk> with black foam — the whale ’ s tail <unk> straight up out of it , perpendicular in the air , like a marble <unk> .
No use <unk> all , then ; but as I was groping at <unk> , with a blinding sun , all <unk> ; as I was groping , I say , after the second iron , to toss it overboard — down comes the tail like a Lima tower , cutting my boat in two , leaving each half in splinters ; and , flukes first , the white hump backed through the wreck , as though it was all chips .
We all struck out .
To escape his terrible <unk> , I seized hold of my <unk> sticking in him , and for a moment <unk> to that like a sucking fish .
But a <unk> sea dashed me off , and at the same instant , the fish , taking one good dart forwards , went down like a flash ; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here ” ( clapping his hand just below his shoulder ) ; “ yes , caught me just here , I say , and bore me down to <unk> ’ s flames , I was thinking ; when , when , all of a sudden , thank the good God , the barb <unk> its way along the flesh — clear along the whole length of my arm — came out nigh my wrist , and up I floated ; — and that gentleman there will tell you the rest ( by the way , captain — Dr.
Bunger , ship ’ s surgeon : Bunger , my lad , — the captain ) .
Now , Bunger boy , <unk> your part of the yarn . ” The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out , had been all the time standing near them , with nothing specific visible , to <unk> his <unk> <unk> on board .
His face was an exceedingly round but sober one ; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen <unk> or shirt , and patched trowsers ; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a <unk> he held in one hand , and a <unk> held in the other , occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two <unk> captains .
But , at his superior ’ s <unk> of him to Ahab , he politely bowed , and straightway went on to do his captain ’ s bidding .
“ It was a <unk> bad wound , ” began the <unk> ; “ and , taking my advice , Captain <unk> here , stood our old <unk> — ” “ Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship , ” interrupted the <unk> captain , <unk> Ahab ; “ go on , boy . ” “ <unk> our old <unk> off to the northward , to get out of the blazing hot weather there on the Line .
But it was no use — I did all I could ; sat up with him nights ; was very severe with him in the matter of <unk> — ” “ Oh , very severe ! ” <unk> in the patient himself ; then suddenly <unk> his voice , “ <unk> hot <unk> <unk> with me every night , till he couldn ’ t see to put on the <unk> ; and sending me to bed , half seas over , about three o ’ clock in the morning .
Oh , ye stars !
he sat up with me indeed , and was very severe in my <unk> .
Oh !
a great <unk> , and very <unk> severe , is Dr. Bunger .
( Bunger , you dog , laugh out !
why don ’ t ye ?
You know you ’ re a precious jolly rascal . )
But , heave ahead , boy , I ’ d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man . ” “ My captain , you must have ere this perceived , <unk> sir ” — said the <unk> <unk> Bunger , slightly bowing to Ahab — “ is apt to be <unk> at times ; he <unk> us many <unk> things of that sort .
But I may as well say — <unk> <unk> , as the French <unk> — that I myself — that is to say , <unk> Bunger , late of the reverend <unk> — am a <unk> <unk> <unk> man ; I never drink — ” “ Water ! ” cried the captain ; “ he never <unk> it ; it ’ s a sort of fits to him ; fresh water <unk> him into the <unk> ; but go on — go on with the arm story . ” “ Yes , I may as well , ” said the surgeon , coolly .
“ I was about observing , sir , before Captain <unk> ’ s <unk> <unk> , that spite of my best and <unk> endeavors , the wound kept getting worse and worse ; the truth was , sir , it was as <unk> <unk> wound as surgeon ever saw ; more than two feet and several inches long .
I measured it with the lead line .
In short , it grew black ; I knew what was threatened , and off it came .
But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there ; that thing is against all rule ” — pointing at it with the <unk> — “ that is the captain ’ s work , not mine ; he ordered the carpenter to make it ; he had that <unk> there put to the end , to <unk> some one ’ s brains out with , I suppose , as he tried mine once .
He flies into <unk> <unk> sometimes .
Do ye see this <unk> , sir ” — removing his hat , and <unk> aside his hair , and <unk> a <unk> cavity in his skull , but which bore not the slightest <unk> trace , or any token of ever having been a wound — “ Well , the captain there will tell you how that came here ; he knows . ” “ No , I don ’ t , ” said the captain , “ but his mother did ; he was born with it .
Oh , you solemn <unk> , you — you Bunger !
was there ever such another Bunger in the watery world ?
Bunger , when you die , you ought to die in pickle , you dog ; you should be preserved to future ages , you rascal . ” “ What became of the White Whale ? ” now cried Ahab , who thus far had been <unk> listening to this <unk> between the two <unk> .
“ Oh ! ” cried the <unk> captain , “ oh , yes !
Well ; after he sounded , we didn ’ t see him again for some time ; in fact , as I before hinted , I didn ’ t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick , till some time afterwards , when coming back to the Line , we heard about Moby Dick — as some call him — and then I knew it was he . ” “ Did ’ st thou cross his wake again ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ But could not fasten ? ” “ Didn ’ t want to try to : ain ’ t one limb enough ?
What should I do without this other arm ?
And I ’ m thinking Moby Dick <unk> ’ t <unk> so much as he <unk> . ” “ Well , then , ” interrupted Bunger , “ give him your left arm for <unk> to get the right .
Do you know , gentlemen ” — very <unk> and <unk> bowing to each Captain in succession — “ Do you know , gentlemen , that the <unk> <unk> of the whale are so <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> , that it is quite impossible for him to completely <unk> even a man ’ s arm ?
And he knows it too .
So that what you take for the White Whale ’ s malice is only his <unk> .
For he never means to swallow a single limb ; he only thinks to <unk> by <unk> .
But sometimes he is like the old <unk> fellow , <unk> a patient of mine in <unk> , that making believe swallow <unk> , once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest , and there it stayed for a <unk> or more ; when I gave him an <unk> , and he heaved it up in small <unk> , d ’ ye see .
No possible way for him to <unk> that jack-knife , and fully <unk> it into his general bodily system .
Yes , Captain <unk> , if you are quick enough about it , and have a mind to <unk> one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent <unk> to the other , why in that case the arm is yours ; only let the whale have another chance at you shortly , that ’ s all . ” “ No , thank ye , Bunger , ” said the English Captain , “ he ’ s welcome to the arm he has , since I can ’ t help it , and didn ’ t know him then ; but not to another one .
No more White Whales for me ; I ’ ve lowered for him once , and that has satisfied me .
There would be great glory in <unk> him , I know that ; and there is a <unk> of precious sperm in him , but , <unk> ye , he ’ s best let alone ; don ’ t you think so , Captain ? ” — glancing at the ivory leg .
“ He is .
But he will still be hunted , for all that .
What is best let alone , that accursed thing is not always what least <unk> .
He ’ s all a <unk> !
How long since thou saw ’ st him last ?
Which way heading ? ” “ <unk> my soul , and <unk> the foul fiend ’ s , ” cried Bunger , <unk> walking round Ahab , and like a dog , strangely <unk> ; “ this man ’ s blood — bring the <unk> ! — it ’ s at the boiling point ! — his <unk> makes these planks beat ! — sir ! ” — taking a <unk> from his pocket , and drawing near to Ahab ’ s arm .
“ Avast ! ” roared Ahab , dashing him against the bulwarks — “ Man the boat !
Which way heading ? ” “ Good God ! ” cried the English Captain , to whom the question was put .
“ What ’ s the matter ?
He was heading east , I think . — Is your Captain crazy ? ” <unk> Fedallah .
But Fedallah , putting a finger on his lip , slid over the bulwarks to take the boat ’ s steering oar , and Ahab , swinging the <unk> towards him , commanded the ship ’ s sailors to stand by to lower .
In a moment he was standing in the boat ’ s stern , and the Manilla men were springing to their oars .
In vain the English Captain hailed him .
With back to the stranger ship , and face set like a <unk> to his own , Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
Ere the English ship <unk> from sight , be it set down here , that she hailed from London , and was named after the late Samuel Enderby , merchant of that city , the original of the famous whaling house of Enderby <unk> <unk> ; a house which in my poor whaleman ’ s opinion , comes not far behind the united royal houses of the <unk> and <unk> , in point of real historical interest .
How long , prior to the year of our Lord <unk> , this great whaling house was in existence , my numerous <unk> do not make plain ; but in that year ( <unk> ) it fitted out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale ; though for some score of years previous ( ever since <unk> ) our valiant <unk> and <unk> of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large <unk> pursued that Leviathan , but only in the North and South Atlantic : not elsewhere .
Be it distinctly recorded here , that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale ; and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him .
In <unk> , a fine ship , the <unk> , fitted out for the express purpose , and at the sole charge of the vigorous <unk> , boldly rounded Cape Horn , and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the great South Sea .
The voyage was a <unk> and lucky one ; and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm , the <unk> ’ s example was soon followed by other ships , English and American , and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open .
But not content with this good deed , the <unk> house again <unk> itself : Samuel and all his <unk> — how many , their mother only knows — and under their immediate <unk> , and partly , I think , at their expense , the <unk> <unk> was induced to send the <unk> <unk> on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea .
<unk> by a <unk> <unk> , the <unk> made a rattling voyage of it , and did some service ; how much does not appear .
But this is not all .
In <unk> , the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own , to go on a <unk> cruise to the remote waters of Japan .
That ship — well called the “ <unk> ” — made a noble <unk> cruise ; and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known .
The <unk> in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin , a Nantucketer .
All honor to the <unk> , therefore , whose house , I think , exists to the present day ; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world .
The ship named after him was worthy of the honor , being a very fast <unk> and a noble craft every way .
I boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the Patagonian coast , and <unk> good flip down in the forecastle .
It was a fine <unk> we had , and they were all <unk> — every soul on board .
A short life to them , and a jolly death .
And that fine <unk> I had — long , very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel — it minds me of the noble , solid , <unk> <unk> of that ship ; and may my <unk> forget me , and the devil remember me , if I ever lose sight of it .
<unk> ?
Did I say we had flip ?
Yes , and we <unk> it at the rate of ten gallons the hour ; and when the squall came ( for it ’ s <unk> off there by <unk> ) , and all hands — <unk> and all — were called to <unk> <unk> , we were so <unk> that we had to swing each other aloft in <unk> ; and we ignorantly <unk> the <unk> of our jackets into the sails , so that we hung there , <unk> fast in the howling gale , a warning example to all <unk> <unk> .
However , the masts did not go overboard ; and by and by we <unk> down , so sober , that we had to pass the flip again , though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle , rather too much <unk> and <unk> it to my taste .
The beef was fine — tough , but with body in it .
They said it was <unk> ; others , that it was <unk> beef ; but I do not know , for certain , how that was .
They had dumplings too ; small , but <unk> , <unk> globular , and <unk> dumplings .
I fancied that you could feel them , and roll them about in you after they were swallowed .
If you stooped over too far forward , you <unk> their pitching out of you like <unk> .
The bread — but that couldn ’ t be helped ; besides , it was an <unk> ; in short , the bread contained the only fresh fare they had .
But the forecastle was not very light , and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you <unk> it .
But all in all , taking her from <unk> to helm , considering the <unk> of the cook ’ s <unk> , including his own live <unk> <unk> ; fore and aft , I say , the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship ; of good fare and plenty ; fine flip and strong ; crack fellows all , and <unk> from <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
But why was it , think ye , that the Samuel Enderby , and some other English whalers I know of — not all though — were such famous , hospitable ships ; that passed round the beef , and the bread , and the can , and the joke ; and were not soon weary of eating , and drinking , and <unk> ?
I will tell you .
The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter for historical research .
Nor have I been at all <unk> of historical whale research , when it has seemed needed .
The English were <unk> in the whale fishery by the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ; from whom they derived many terms still <unk> in the fishery ; and what is yet more , their fat old <unk> , touching plenty to eat and drink .
For , as a general thing , the English <unk> <unk> her crew ; but not so the English whaler .
Hence , in the English , this thing of whaling good cheer is not <unk> and natural , but <unk> and particular ; and , therefore , must have some special <unk> , which is here pointed out , and will be still further <unk> .
During my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , I <unk> upon an ancient Dutch volume , which , by the <unk> whaling smell of it , I knew must be about whalers .
The title was , “ Dan <unk> , ” wherefore I concluded that this must be the <unk> <unk> of some <unk> cooper in the fishery , as every whale ship must carry its cooper .
I was <unk> in this opinion by seeing that it was the <unk> of one “ <unk> <unk> . ” But my friend Dr. <unk> , a very learned man , professor of <unk> Dutch and High German in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and St. <unk> ’ s , to whom I <unk> the work for <unk> , giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble — this same Dr. <unk> , so soon as he <unk> the book , assured me that “ Dan <unk> ” did not mean “ The <unk> , ” but “ The <unk> . ” In short , this ancient and learned <unk> Dutch book treated of the commerce of Holland ; and , among other subjects , contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery .
And in this chapter it was , headed , “ <unk> , ” or “ <unk> , ” that I found a long <unk> list of the <unk> for the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> sail of Dutch whalemen ; from which list , as <unk> by Dr. <unk> , I <unk> the following : <unk> lbs .
of beef .
<unk> lbs .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> lbs .
of stock fish .
<unk> lbs .
of biscuit .
<unk> lbs .
of soft bread .
<unk> <unk> of butter .
<unk> lbs .
<unk> <unk> <unk> cheese .
<unk> lbs .
cheese ( probably an inferior article ) .
<unk> <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> barrels of beer .
Most <unk> <unk> are <unk> dry in the reading ; not so in the present case , however , where the reader is <unk> with whole pipes , barrels , <unk> , and gills of good gin and good cheer .
At the time , I <unk> three days to the <unk> <unk> of all this beer , beef , and bread , during which many profound thoughts were incidentally <unk> to me , capable of a <unk> and <unk> application ; and , <unk> , I <unk> <unk> <unk> of my own , touching the probable quantity of <unk> , <unk> . , consumed by every <unk> Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery .
In the first place , the amount of butter , and <unk> and <unk> cheese consumed , seems amazing .
I <unk> it , though , to their naturally unctuous <unk> , being <unk> still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation , and especially by their pursuing their game in those <unk> Polar Seas , on the very coasts of that <unk> country where the convivial <unk> <unk> each other in <unk> of train oil .
The quantity of beer , too , is very large , <unk> barrels .
Now , as those <unk> <unk> could only be <unk> in the short summer of that <unk> , so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen , including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea , did not much exceed three months , say , and <unk> 30 men to each of their fleet of <unk> sail , we have <unk> <unk> Dutch seamen in all ; therefore , I say , we have precisely two barrels of beer <unk> man , for a twelve weeks ’ <unk> , <unk> of his fair <unk> of that <unk> <unk> of gin .
Now , whether these gin and beer harpooneers , so <unk> as one might fancy them to have been , were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat ’ s head , and take good <unk> at flying whales ; this would seem somewhat <unk> .
Yet they did <unk> at them , and hit them too .
But this was very far North , be it remembered , where beer <unk> well with the <unk> ; upon the Equator , in our southern fishery , beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and <unk> in his boat ; and <unk> loss might <unk> to Nantucket and New Bedford .
But no more ; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high <unk> ; and that the English whalers have not <unk> so excellent an example .
For , say they , when cruising in an empty ship , if you can get nothing better out of the world , get a good dinner out of it , at least .
And this <unk> the <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> .
A <unk> in the Arsacides .
<unk> , in <unk> <unk> of the Sperm Whale , I have chiefly <unk> upon the marvels of his outer aspect ; or separately and in detail upon some few interior <unk> features .
But to a large and <unk> sweeping <unk> of him , it <unk> me now to <unk> him still further , and <unk> the points of his <unk> , <unk> his <unk> , and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones , set him before you in his <unk> ; that is to say , in his unconditional skeleton .
But how now , Ishmael ?
How is it , that you , a mere oarsman in the fishery , pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale ?
Did <unk> Stubb , mounted upon your capstan , <unk> <unk> on the anatomy of the <unk> ; and by help of the windlass , hold up a specimen rib for <unk> ?
<unk> thyself , Ishmael .
Can you land a full-grown whale on your deck for <unk> , as a cook <unk> a <unk> ?
Surely not .
A veritable <unk> have you hitherto been , Ishmael ; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone ; the privilege of <unk> upon the <unk> and beams ; the <unk> , <unk> , sleepers , and <unk> , making up the <unk> of leviathan ; and <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> in his bowels .
I confess , that since Jonah , few whalemen have <unk> very far beneath the skin of the <unk> whale ; nevertheless , I have been blessed with an opportunity to <unk> him in <unk> .
In a ship I belonged to , a small <unk> Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his <unk> or bag , to make <unk> for the barbs of the harpoons , and for the heads of the lances .
Think you I let that chance go , without using my <unk> and jack-knife , and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that young <unk> ?
And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic , full grown <unk> , for that rare knowledge I am <unk> to my late royal friend Tranquo , king of Tranque , one of the Arsacides .
For being at Tranque , years ago , when attached to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , I was invited to spend part of the <unk> <unk> with the lord of Tranque , at his retired palm <unk> at <unk> ; a <unk> <unk> not very far distant from what our sailors called <unk> , his <unk> .
Among many other fine qualities , my royal friend Tranquo , being <unk> with a devout love for all matters of barbaric <unk> , had brought together in <unk> whatever rare things the more <unk> of his people could <unk> ; chiefly carved woods of wonderful <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> spears , <unk> <unk> , <unk> canoes ; and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders , the <unk> , <unk> waves had cast upon his shores .
Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale , which , after an unusually long raging gale , had been found dead and stranded , with his head against a <unk> tree , whose <unk> , tufted <unk> seemed his <unk> jet .
When the vast body had at last been stripped of its <unk> <unk> , and the bones become dust dry in the sun , then the skeleton was carefully <unk> up the <unk> <unk> , where a grand <unk> of <unk> palms now <unk> it .
The ribs were hung with <unk> ; the vertebræ were carved with <unk> <unk> , in strange hieroglyphics ; in the skull , the priests kept up an <unk> <unk> flame , so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapory spout ; while , suspended from a <unk> , the terrific lower jaw <unk> over all the <unk> , like the <unk> sword that so affrighted <unk> .
It was a wondrous sight .
The wood was green as <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ; the trees stood high and haughty , feeling their living <unk> ; the <unk> earth beneath was as a weaver ’ s loom , with a <unk> <unk> on it , <unk> the <unk> <unk> formed the warp and woof , and the living flowers the figures .
All the trees , with all their laden branches ; all the <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> ; the <unk> air ; all these <unk> were active .
Through the <unk> of the leaves , the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the <unk> verdure .
Oh , busy weaver !
unseen weaver ! — pause ! — one word ! — <unk> <unk> the <unk> ?
what <unk> may it deck ?
wherefore all these <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> , weaver ! — stay thy hand ! — but one single word with thee !
Nay — the shuttle flies — the figures float from forth the loom ; the <unk> <unk> for ever <unk> away .
The <unk> , he <unk> ; and by that weaving is he <unk> , that he hears no mortal voice ; and by that humming , we , too , who look on the loom are <unk> ; and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it .
For even so it is in all material <unk> .
The spoken words that are <unk> among the flying <unk> ; those same words are plainly heard without the walls , bursting from the opened <unk> .
<unk> have <unk> been <unk> .
Ah , mortal !
then , be heedful ; for so , in all this din of the great world ’ s loom , thy <unk> <unk> may be <unk> afar .
Now , amid the green , <unk> loom of that <unk> wood , the great , white , <unk> skeleton lay lounging — a gigantic <unk> !
Yet , as the <unk> <unk> warp and woof <unk> and <unk> around him , the mighty <unk> seemed the cunning weaver ; himself all woven over with the <unk> ; every month <unk> <unk> , <unk> verdure ; but himself a skeleton .
Life folded Death ; Death <unk> Life ; the grim god <unk> with <unk> Life , and <unk> him <unk> <unk> .
Now , when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale , and saw the skull an altar , and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued , I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of <unk> .
He laughed .
But more I marvelled that the priests should swear that <unk> jet of his was <unk> .
To and fro I paced before this skeleton — <unk> the <unk> aside — broke through the ribs — and with a ball of <unk> twine , <unk> , <unk> long amid its many winding , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
But soon my line was out ; and following it back , I emerged from the opening where I entered .
I saw no living thing within ; naught was there but bones .
<unk> me a green <unk> , I once more dived within the skeleton .
From their <unk> in the skull , the priests perceived me taking the <unk> of the final rib , “ How now ! ” they shouted ; “ <unk> ’ st thou measure this our god !
That ’ s for us . ” “ Aye , priests — well , how long do ye make him , then ? ” But <unk> a fierce <unk> rose among them , concerning feet and inches ; they cracked each other ’ s <unk> with their <unk> — the great skull <unk> — and seizing that lucky chance , I quickly concluded my own <unk> .
These <unk> I now propose to set before you .
But first , be it recorded , that , in this matter , I am not free to utter any fancied <unk> I please .
Because there are skeleton authorities you can <unk> to , to test my <unk> .
There is a <unk> <unk> , they tell me , in <unk> , England , one of the whaling ports of that country , where they have some fine <unk> of <unk> and other whales .
Likewise , I have heard that in the <unk> of <unk> , in New <unk> , they have what the <unk> call “ the only <unk> specimen of a Greenland or <unk> Whale in the United States . ” Moreover , at a place in <unk> , England , <unk> <unk> by name , a certain Sir <unk> <unk> has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale , but of <unk> size , by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo ’ s .
In both cases , the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged , were originally <unk> by their <unk> upon similar grounds .
King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it ; and Sir <unk> , because he was lord of the <unk> of those parts .
Sir <unk> ’ s whale has been <unk> throughout ; so that , like a great chest of drawers , you can open and shut him , in all his bony <unk> — spread out his ribs like a gigantic <unk> — and swing all day upon his lower jaw .
<unk> are to be put upon some of his <unk> and <unk> ; and a <unk> will show round future <unk> with a bunch of <unk> at his side .
Sir <unk> thinks of <unk> <unk> for a peep at the <unk> <unk> in the spinal <unk> ; <unk> to hear the <unk> in the hollow of his <unk> ; and <unk> for the <unk> view from his forehead .
The skeleton <unk> I shall now proceed to set down are copied <unk> from my right arm , where I had them tattooed ; as in my wild <unk> at that period , there was no other secure way of <unk> such valuable <unk> .
But as I was <unk> for space , and <unk> the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a <unk> I was then <unk> — at least , what <unk> parts might remain — I did not trouble myself with the odd inches ; nor , indeed , should inches at all enter into a congenial <unk> of the whale .
CHAPTER <unk> .
<unk> of The Whale ’ s <unk> .
In the first place , I wish to lay before you a particular , plain <unk> , touching the living bulk of this leviathan , whose skeleton we are <unk> to <unk> .
Such a <unk> may prove useful here .
According to a careful <unk> I have made , and which I partly base upon Captain Scoresby ’ s <unk> , of seventy tons for the largest sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length ; according to my careful <unk> , I say , a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude , between <unk> and <unk> feet in length , and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference , such a whale will weigh at least <unk> tons ; so that , <unk> <unk> men to a <unk> , he would considerably <unk> the combined <unk> of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants .
Think you not then that brains , like <unk> cattle , should be put to this leviathan , to make him at all <unk> to any landsman ’ s imagination ?
<unk> already in various ways put before you his skull , spout-hole , jaw , teeth , tail , forehead , fins , and divers other parts , I shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his <unk> bones .
But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a <unk> of the entire extent of the skeleton ; as it is by far the most complicated part ; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter , you must not fail to carry it in your mind , or under your arm , as we proceed , otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view .
In length , the Sperm Whale ’ s skeleton at Tranque measured <unk> feet ; so that when fully invested and extended in life , he must have been <unk> feet long ; for in the whale , the skeleton <unk> about one fifth in length compared with the living body .
Of this <unk> feet , his skull and jaw <unk> some twenty feet , leaving some fifty feet of plain <unk> .
<unk> to this <unk> , for something less than a third of its length , was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once <unk> his <unk> .
To me this vast <unk> chest , with the long , <unk> spine , extending far away from it in a straight line , not a little <unk> the hull of a great ship <unk> upon the <unk> , when only some twenty of her naked <unk> are inserted , and the keel is otherwise , for the time , but a long , <unk> timber .
The ribs were ten on a side .
The first , to begin from the neck , was nearly six feet long ; the second , third , and fourth were each <unk> longer , till you came to the <unk> of the fifth , or one of the middle ribs , which measured eight feet and some inches .
From that part , the remaining ribs diminished , till the tenth and last only <unk> five feet and some inches .
In general thickness , they all bore a <unk> <unk> to their length .
The middle ribs were the most arched .
In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams <unk> to lay <unk> <unk> over small <unk> .
In considering these ribs , I could not but be struck anew with the circumstance , so <unk> repeated in this book , that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form .
The largest of the Tranque ribs , one of the middle ones , occupied that part of the fish which , in life , is greatest in depth .
Now , the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet ; whereas , the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet .
So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part .
Besides , for some way , where I now saw but a naked spine , all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh , <unk> , blood , and bowels .
Still more , for the <unk> fins , I here saw but a few disordered joints ; and in place of the <unk> and majestic , but <unk> flukes , an utter blank !
How vain and foolish , then , thought I , for timid <unk> man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale , by merely <unk> over his dead <unk> skeleton , stretched in this peaceful wood .
No .
Only in the heart of <unk> perils ; only when within the <unk> of his <unk> flukes ; only on the profound <unk> sea , can the fully invested whale be truly and <unk> found out .
But the spine .
For that , the best way we can consider it is , with a <unk> , to pile its bones high up on end .
No speedy <unk> .
But now it ’ s done , it looks much like <unk> ’ s <unk> .
There are forty and odd vertebræ in all , which in the skeleton are not locked together .
They mostly lie like the great <unk> blocks on a Gothic <unk> , forming solid courses of heavy masonry .
The largest , a middle one , is in <unk> something less than three feet , and in depth more than four .
The smallest , where the spine tapers away into the tail , is only two inches in <unk> , and looks something like a white <unk> .
I was told that there were still smaller ones , but they had been lost by some little cannibal <unk> , the priest ’ s children , who had <unk> them to play <unk> with .
Thus we see how that the spine of even the <unk> of living things tapers off at last into simple child ’ s play .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Fossil Whale .
From his mighty bulk the whale <unk> a most congenial <unk> <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , and generally <unk> .
Would you , you could not <unk> him .
By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial <unk> .
Not to tell over again his <unk> from spiracle to tail , and the yards he <unk> about the waist ; only think of the gigantic <unk> of his <unk> , where they lie in him like great cables and <unk> coiled away in the subterranean <unk> of a <unk> .
<unk> I have <unk> to <unk> this Leviathan , it <unk> me to <unk> myself <unk> <unk> in the <unk> ; not <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> of his blood , and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels .
<unk> already described him in most of his present <unk> and anatomical peculiarities , it now remains to <unk> him in an <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> point of view .
<unk> to any other creature than the Leviathan — to an <unk> or a <unk> — such portly terms might <unk> be deemed <unk> <unk> .
But when Leviathan is the text , the case is <unk> .
<unk> am I to <unk> to this <unk> under the <unk> words of the <unk> .
And here be it said , that whenever it has been convenient to <unk> one in the course of these <unk> , I have invariably used a huge <unk> <unk> of Johnson , <unk> <unk> for that purpose ; because that famous <unk> ’ s uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to <unk> a <unk> to be used by a whale author like me .
One often hears of <unk> that rise and swell with their subject , though it may seem but an ordinary one .
How , then , with me , writing of this Leviathan ?
<unk> my <unk> <unk> into <unk> <unk> .
Give me a <unk> ’ s <unk> !
Give me <unk> ’ <unk> for an <unk> !
<unk> , hold my arms !
For in the mere act of <unk> my thoughts of this Leviathan , they weary me , and make me faint with their <unk> <unk> of sweep , as if to include the whole circle of the <unk> , and all the generations of whales , and men , and <unk> , past , present , and to come , with all the revolving <unk> of <unk> on earth , and throughout the whole universe , not <unk> its <unk> .
Such , and so <unk> , is the virtue of a large and <unk> <unk> !
We expand to its bulk .
To produce a mighty book , you must choose a mighty <unk> .
No great and <unk> volume can ever be written on the <unk> , though many there be who have tried it .
Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales , I present my <unk> as a <unk> , by <unk> that in my miscellaneous time I have been a <unk> , and also a great <unk> of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> of all sorts .
Likewise , by way of preliminary , I desire to <unk> the reader , that while in the earlier <unk> <unk> there are found the <unk> of monsters now almost completely <unk> ; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the <unk> <unk> seem the <unk> , or at any rate <unk> links , between the <unk> creatures , and those whose remote <unk> are said to have entered the <unk> ; all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered belong to the <unk> period , which is the last preceding the <unk> <unk> .
And though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time , they are yet sufficiently <unk> to them in general respects , to <unk> their taking <unk> as <unk> <unk> .
<unk> broken <unk> of <unk> whales , <unk> of their bones and skeletons , have within thirty years past , at various intervals , been found at the base of the <unk> , in <unk> , in France , in England , in <unk> , and in the States of <unk> , <unk> , and Alabama .
Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull , which in the year <unk> was <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in <unk> , a short street opening almost directly upon the <unk> of the <unk> ; and bones <unk> in <unk> the great docks of <unk> , in <unk> ’ s time .
Cuvier pronounced these <unk> to have belonged to some utterly unknown <unk> species .
But by far the most wonderful of all <unk> relics was the almost complete vast skeleton of an <unk> monster , found in the year <unk> , on the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , in Alabama .
The <unk> credulous <unk> in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the <unk> angels .
The Alabama doctors declared it a huge <unk> , and bestowed upon it the name of <unk> .
But some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to Owen , the English <unk> , it turned out that this alleged <unk> was a whale , though of a departed species .
A significant <unk> of the fact , again and again repeated in this book , that the skeleton of the whale <unk> but little <unk> to the shape of his fully invested body .
So Owen <unk> the monster <unk> ; and in his paper read before the London <unk> <unk> , pronounced it , in substance , one of the most extraordinary creatures which the <unk> of the globe have <unk> out of existence .
When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons , skulls , tusks , jaws , ribs , and vertebræ , all <unk> by <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> ; but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar <unk> to the <unk> <unk> Leviathans , their <unk> <unk> ; I am , by a flood , borne back to that wondrous period , ere time itself can be said to have <unk> ; for time began with man .
Here <unk> ’ s grey chaos rolls over me , and I obtain dim , shuddering <unk> into those Polar <unk> ; when <unk> <unk> of ice pressed hard upon what are now the <unk> ; and in all the <unk> miles of this world ’ s circumference , not an <unk> hand ’ s breadth of land was visible .
Then the whole world was the whale ’ s ; and , king of creation , he left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the <unk> .
Who can show a <unk> like Leviathan ?
Ahab ’ s harpoon had shed <unk> blood than the <unk> ’ s .
<unk> seems a <unk> .
I look round to shake hands with <unk> .
I am <unk> at this <unk> , <unk> existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale , which , having been before all time , must needs <unk> after all <unk> ages are over .
But not alone has this Leviathan left his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> plates of nature , and in <unk> and <unk> <unk> his ancient <unk> ; but upon Egyptian tablets , whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost <unk> character , we find the <unk> <unk> of his fin .
In an apartment of the great <unk> of <unk> , some fifty years ago , there was discovered upon the <unk> ceiling a <unk> and painted <unk> , abounding in <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , similar to the <unk> figures on the celestial globe of the <unk> .
<unk> among them , old Leviathan swam as of <unk> ; was there swimming in that <unk> , centuries before Solomon was <unk> .
Nor must there be omitted another strange <unk> of the antiquity of the whale , in his own <unk> <unk> reality , as set down by the venerable John <unk> , the old <unk> traveller .
“ Not far from the <unk> , they have a Temple , the <unk> and <unk> of which are made of <unk> ; for Whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore .
The <unk> People imagine , that by a secret <unk> bestowed by God upon the Temple , no Whale can pass it without immediate death .
But the truth of the <unk> is , that on either side of the Temple , there are <unk> that shoot two <unk> into the Sea , and wound the Whales when they light upon ’ em .
They keep a Whale ’ s <unk> of an incredible length for a <unk> , which lying upon the Ground with its <unk> part <unk> , makes an <unk> , the Head of which cannot be reached by a Man upon a <unk> ’ s Back .
This <unk> ( says John <unk> ) is said to have <unk> there a hundred <unk> before I saw it .
Their <unk> <unk> , that a Prophet who <unk> ’ d of <unk> , came from this Temple , and some do not stand to assert , that the Prophet <unk> was cast forth by the Whale at the <unk> of the Temple . ” In this <unk> Temple of the Whale I leave you , reader , and if you be a Nantucketer , and a whaleman , you will silently worship there .
CHAPTER <unk> .
Does the Whale ’ s <unk> <unk> ? — Will He <unk> ?
<unk> , then , as this Leviathan comes <unk> down upon us from the <unk> of the <unk> , it may be <unk> <unk> , whether , in the long course of his generations , he has not <unk> from the original bulk of his <unk> .
But upon <unk> we find , that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose <unk> remains are found in the <unk> system ( <unk> a distinct <unk> period prior to man ) , but of the whales found in that <unk> system , those belonging to its latter <unk> exceed in size those of its earlier ones .
Of all the <unk> whales yet <unk> , by far the largest is the Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter , and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton .
Whereas , we have already seen , that the <unk> gives <unk> feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale .
And I have heard , on whalemen ’ s authority , that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture .
But may it not be , that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous <unk> <unk> ; may it not be , that since Adam ’ s time they have <unk> ?
<unk> , we must conclude so , if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as Pliny , and the ancient naturalists generally .
For Pliny tells us of whales that embraced <unk> of living bulk , and <unk> of others which measured eight hundred feet in length — <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of Whales !
And even in the days of Banks and <unk> , <unk> ’ s naturalists , we find a <unk> member of the <unk> of <unk> setting down certain <unk> Whales ( <unk> , or <unk> <unk> ) at one hundred and twenty yards ; that is , three hundred and sixty feet .
And <unk> , the French <unk> , in his <unk> history of whales , in the very beginning of his work ( page 3 ) , sets down the Right Whale at one hundred <unk> , three hundred and <unk> feet .
And this work was published so late as A.D. <unk> .
But will any whaleman believe these stories ?
No .
The whale of to-day is as big as his <unk> in Pliny ’ s time .
And if ever I go where Pliny is , I , a whaleman ( more than he was ) , will make bold to tell him so .
Because I cannot understand how it is , that while the Egyptian <unk> that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born , do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern <unk> in his socks ; and while the cattle and other animals <unk> on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets , by the <unk> <unk> in which they are drawn , just as plainly prove that the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> cattle of <unk> , not only equal , but far exceed in magnitude the <unk> of <unk> ’ s fat <unk> ; in the face of all this , I will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have <unk> .
But still another inquiry remains ; one often agitated by the more <unk> Nantucketers .
Whether owing to the almost <unk> look-outs at the mast-heads of the whale-ships , now <unk> even through <unk> ’ s straits , and into the remotest secret drawers and <unk> of the world ; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all <unk> coasts ; the <unk> point is , whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase , and so remorseless a <unk> ; whether he must not at last be <unk> from the waters , and the last whale , like the last man , smoke his last pipe , and then himself <unk> in the final puff .
<unk> the <unk> herds of whales with the <unk> herds of buffalo , which , not forty years ago , <unk> by <unk> of thousands the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and shook their iron <unk> and <unk> with their <unk> <unk> upon the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , where now the polite <unk> <unk> you land at a <unk> an inch ; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished , to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy <unk> .
But you must look at this matter in every light .
Though so short a period ago — not a good lifetime — the census of the buffalo in <unk> <unk> the census of men now in London , and though at the present day not one horn or <unk> of them remains in all that region ; and though the cause of this wondrous <unk> was the spear of man ; yet the far different nature of the <unk> <unk> <unk> so <unk> an end to the Leviathan .
<unk> men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for <unk> months think they have done <unk> well , and thank God , if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish .
Whereas , in the days of the old <unk> and Indian hunters and <unk> of the West , when the far west ( in whose sunset <unk> still rise ) was a <unk> and a virgin , the same number of <unk> men , for the same number of months , mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships , would have slain not forty , but forty thousand and more <unk> ; a fact that , if need were , could be <unk> stated .
Nor , considered aright , does it seem any argument in <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the Sperm Whale , for example , that in former years ( the latter part of the last century , say ) these Leviathans , in small <unk> , were encountered much oftener than at present , and , in consequence , the voyages were not so prolonged , and were also much more <unk> .
Because , as has been elsewhere noticed , those whales , <unk> by some <unk> to safety , now swim the seas in immense <unk> , so that to a large degree the scattered <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and schools of other days are now <unk> into vast but widely separated , <unk> <unk> .
That is all .
And equally <unk> seems the conceit , that because the <unk> whale-bone whales no longer <unk> many grounds in former years abounding with them , hence that species also is <unk> .
For they are only being driven from promontory to <unk> ; and if one coast is no longer <unk> with their jets , then , be sure , some other and <unk> <unk> has been very recently startled by the <unk> spectacle .
<unk> : concerning these last mentioned Leviathans , they have two firm <unk> , which , in all human probability , will for ever remain impregnable .
And as upon the <unk> of their valleys , the frosty <unk> have retreated to their mountains ; so , hunted from the <unk> and <unk> of the middle seas , the whale-bone whales can at last <unk> to their Polar <unk> , and diving under the ultimate <unk> <unk> and walls there , come up among icy fields and <unk> ; and in a <unk> circle of everlasting December , bid <unk> to all pursuit from man .
But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one <unk> , some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this <unk> <unk> has already very <unk> diminished their <unk> .
But though for some time past a number of these whales , not less than <unk> , have been <unk> slain on the nor ’ west coast by the Americans alone ; yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter .
Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the <unk> of the more enormous creatures of the globe , yet what shall we say to <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , when he tells us that at one hunting the King of <unk> took <unk> elephants ; that in those <unk> elephants are numerous as <unk> of cattle in the <unk> climes .
And there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants , which have now been hunted for thousands of years , by <unk> , by <unk> , by <unk> , and by all the successive <unk> of the East — if they still survive there in great numbers , much more may the great whale <unk> all hunting , since he has a pasture to <unk> in , which is precisely twice as large as all Asia , both <unk> , Europe and Africa , New Holland , and all the <unk> of the sea combined .
Moreover : we are to consider , that from the presumed great <unk> of whales , their probably attaining the age of a century and more , therefore at any one period of time , several distinct <unk> generations must be <unk> .
And what that is , we may soon gain some idea of , by <unk> all the <unk> , <unk> , and family <unk> of creation <unk> up the live bodies of all the men , women , and children who were alive <unk> years ago ; and <unk> this countless host to the present human <unk> of the globe .
Wherefore , for all these things , we account the whale immortal in his species , however <unk> in his <unk> .
He swam the seas before the <unk> broke water ; he once swam over the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> .
In Noah ’ s flood he <unk> Noah ’ s <unk> ; and if ever the world is to be again <unk> , like the <unk> , to kill off its <unk> , then the eternal whale will still survive , and rearing upon the topmost <unk> of the equatorial flood , spout his <unk> <unk> to the skies .
CHAPTER <unk> .
Ahab ’ s Leg .
The <unk> manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel Enderby of London , had not been <unk> with some small violence to his own person .
He had lighted with such energy upon a <unk> of his boat that his ivory leg had received a <unk> shock .
And when after gaining his own deck , and his own pivot-hole there , he so <unk> <unk> round with an <unk> command to the steersman ( it was , as ever , something about his not steering <unk> enough ) ; then , the already <unk> ivory received such an additional <unk> and <unk> , that though it still remained entire , and to all appearances <unk> , yet Ahab did not <unk> it entirely <unk> .
And , indeed , it seemed small matter for wonder , that for all his <unk> , mad <unk> , Ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood .
For it had not been very long prior to the Pequod ’ s sailing from Nantucket , that he had been found one night lying <unk> upon the ground , and <unk> ; by some unknown , and seemingly inexplicable , unimaginable <unk> , his ivory limb having been so violently <unk> , that it had <unk> smitten , and all but <unk> his <unk> ; nor was it without extreme difficulty that the <unk> wound was entirely <unk> .
Nor , at the time , had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind , that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct <unk> of a former woe ; and he too plainly seemed to see , that as the most <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> his kind as <unk> as the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> ; so , equally with every <unk> , all miserable events do naturally beget their like .
Yea , more than equally , thought Ahab ; since both the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> go further than the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> .
For , not to hint of this : that it is an inference from certain <unk> <unk> , that while some natural <unk> here shall have no children born to them for the other world , but , on the contrary , shall be followed by the <unk> of all hell ’ s despair ; whereas , some guilty mortal <unk> shall still <unk> beget to themselves an eternally <unk> <unk> of <unk> beyond the grave ; not at all to hint of this , there still seems an <unk> in the deeper <unk> of the thing .
For , thought Ahab , while even the highest earthly <unk> ever have a certain <unk> <unk> lurking in them , but , at bottom , all <unk> , a mystic significance , and , in some men , an <unk> grandeur ; so do their <unk> <unk> not <unk> the obvious <unk> .
To <unk> the <unk> of these high mortal <unk> , carries us at last among the <unk> <unk> of the gods ; so that , in the face of all the glad , <unk> <unk> , and soft <unk> , round <unk> , we must needs give in to this : that the gods themselves are not for ever glad .
The <unk> , sad <unk> in the brow of man , is but the <unk> of sorrow in the <unk> .
<unk> here a secret has been <unk> , which perhaps might more properly , in set way , have been <unk> before .
With many other particulars concerning Ahab , always had it remained a mystery to some , why it was , that for a certain period , both before and after the sailing of the Pequod , he had hidden himself away with such <unk> <unk> ; and , for that one interval , sought speechless refuge , as it were , among the marble <unk> of the dead .
Captain Peleg ’ s <unk> reason for this thing appeared by no means <unk> ; though , indeed , as touching all Ahab ’ s deeper part , every <unk> <unk> more of significant darkness than of <unk> light .
But , in the end , it all came out ; this one matter did , at least .
That direful <unk> was at the bottom of his temporary <unk> .
And not only this , but to that <unk> , dropping circle ashore , who , for any reason , possessed the privilege of a less <unk> approach to him ; to that timid circle the above hinted <unk> — remaining , as it did , <unk> <unk> for by Ahab — invested itself with terrors , not entirely <unk> from the land of spirits and of <unk> .
So that , through their <unk> for him , they had all <unk> , so far as in them lay , to <unk> up the knowledge of this thing from others ; and hence it was , that not till a considerable interval had elapsed , did it <unk> upon the Pequod ’ s decks .
But be all this as it may ; let the unseen , <unk> <unk> in the air , or the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of fire , have to do or not with earthly Ahab , yet , in this present matter of his leg , he took plain practical <unk> ; — he called the carpenter .
And when that <unk> appeared before him , he bade him without <unk> set about making a new leg , and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> ( Sperm Whale ) which had thus far been <unk> on the voyage , in order that a careful <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> stuff might be secured .
This done , the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night ; and to provide all the <unk> for it , independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use .
Moreover , the ship ’ s forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary <unk> in the hold ; and , to <unk> the affair , the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the <unk> of whatever iron contrivances might be needed .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Carpenter .
<unk> thyself <unk> among the <unk> of <unk> , and take high <unk> man alone ; and he seems a wonder , a grandeur , and a woe .
But from the same point , take mankind in mass , and for the most part , they seem a mob of unnecessary <unk> , both <unk> and hereditary .
But most <unk> though he was , and far from <unk> an example of the high , <unk> <unk> ; the Pequod ’ s carpenter was no <unk> ; hence , he now comes in person on this stage .
Like all <unk> ship carpenters , and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels , he was , to a certain <unk> , practical extent , alike experienced in numerous <unk> and <unk> <unk> to his own ; the carpenter ’ s pursuit being the ancient and <unk> trunk of all those numerous <unk> which more or less have to do with wood as an <unk> material .
But , besides the application to him of the generic <unk> above , this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly <unk> in those thousand nameless mechanical <unk> continually <unk> in a large ship , upon a three or four years ’ voyage , in <unk> and <unk> seas .
For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary <unk> : — <unk> stove boats , sprung spars , <unk> the shape of <unk> oars , <unk> bull ’ s eyes in the deck , or new <unk> in the side planks , and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business ; he was moreover <unk> <unk> in all manner of <unk> <unk> , both useful and <unk> .
The one grand stage where he <unk> all his various parts so <unk> , was his <unk> ; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several <unk> , of different <unk> , and both of iron and of wood .
At all times except when whales were alongside , this bench was <unk> lashed <unk> against the rear of the <unk> .
A <unk> pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole : the carpenter <unk> it into one of his <unk> <unk> , and straightway <unk> it smaller .
A lost <unk> of strange <unk> <unk> on board , and is made a <unk> : out of clean <unk> rods of <unk> bone , and <unk> of sperm whale ivory , the carpenter makes a <unk> <unk> for it .
An oarsman <unk> his wrist : the carpenter <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
Stubb <unk> for <unk> stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar ; <unk> each oar in his big vice of wood , the carpenter <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
A sailor takes a fancy to wear <unk> <unk> : the carpenter <unk> his ears .
Another has the <unk> : the carpenter out <unk> , and clapping one hand upon his bench <unk> him be seated there ; but the poor fellow <unk> <unk> under the <unk> operation ; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice , the carpenter signs him to <unk> his jaw in that , if he would have him draw the tooth .
Thus , this carpenter was prepared at all points , and alike indifferent and without respect in all .
<unk> he accounted bits of ivory ; heads he deemed but <unk> ; men themselves he lightly held for <unk> .
But while now upon so wide a field thus <unk> accomplished and with such <unk> of <unk> in him , too ; all this would seem to <unk> some uncommon <unk> of intelligence .
But not precisely so .
For nothing was this man more remarkable , than for a certain <unk> <unk> as it were ; <unk> , I say ; for it so <unk> off into the surrounding infinite of things , that it seemed one with the general <unk> discernible in the whole visible world ; which while <unk> active in <unk> <unk> , still eternally holds its peace , and <unk> you , though you dig foundations for <unk> .
Yet was this <unk> <unk> in him , <unk> , too , as it appeared , an <unk> <unk> ; — yet was it <unk> dashed at times , with an old , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , not <unk> now and then with a certain <unk> <unk> ; such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the <unk> forecastle of Noah ’ s ark .
Was it that this old carpenter had been a <unk> <unk> , whose much rolling , to and fro , not only had gathered no <unk> ; but what is more , had <unk> off whatever small outward <unk> might have originally <unk> to him ?
He was a <unk> <unk> ; an <unk> <unk> ; <unk> as a <unk> <unk> ; living without <unk> reference to this world or the next .
You might almost say , that this strange <unk> in him involved a sort of <unk> ; for in his numerous <unk> , he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct , or simply because he had been <unk> to it , or by any <unk> of all these , even or <unk> ; but merely by a kind of <unk> and dumb , <unk> <unk> process .
He was a pure <unk> ; his brain , if he had ever had one , must have early <unk> along into the muscles of his fingers .
He was like one of those <unk> but still highly useful , _ <unk> in <unk> _ , <unk> contrivances , <unk> the <unk> — though a little swelled — of a common pocket knife ; but containing , not only blades of various <unk> , but also <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
So , if his <unk> wanted to use the carpenter for a <unk> , all they had to do was to open that part of him , and the <unk> was fast : or if for <unk> , take him up by the legs , and there they were .
Yet , as previously hinted , this <unk> , <unk> carpenter , was , after all , no mere <unk> of an <unk> .
If he did not have a common soul in him , he had a subtle something that somehow <unk> did its duty .
What that was , whether <unk> of <unk> , or a few drops of <unk> , there is no telling .
But there it was ; and there it had <unk> for now some sixty years or more .
And this it was , this same unaccountable , cunning <unk> in him ; this it was , that kept him a great part of the time <unk> ; but only like an <unk> wheel , which also <unk> <unk> ; or rather , his body was a <unk> and this <unk> on guard there , and talking all the time to keep himself awake .
CHAPTER <unk> .
Ahab and the Carpenter .
The Deck — First <unk> Watch .
( _ Carpenter standing before his <unk> , and by the light of two lanterns <unk> <unk> the ivory <unk> for the leg , which <unk> is firmly fixed in the vice .
<unk> of ivory , leather straps , <unk> , <unk> , and various <unk> of all sorts lying about the bench .
<unk> , the red flame of the forge is seen , where the blacksmith is at work . _ ) <unk> the file , and <unk> the bone !
That is hard which should be soft , and that is soft which should be hard .
So we go , who file old jaws and <unk> .
Let ’ s try another .
Aye , now , this works better ( _ sneezes _ ) .
Halloa , this bone dust is ( _ sneezes _ ) — why it ’ s ( _ sneezes _ ) — yes it ’ s ( _ sneezes _ ) — bless my soul , it won ’ t let me speak !
This is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead <unk> .
<unk> a live tree , and you don ’ t get this dust ; <unk> a live bone , and you don ’ t get it ( _ sneezes _ ) .
Come , come , you old <unk> , there , bear a hand , and let ’ s have that <unk> and <unk> ; I ’ ll be ready for them presently .
<unk> now ( _ sneezes _ ) there ’ s no <unk> to make ; that might <unk> a little ; but a mere <unk> — why it ’ s easy as making <unk> ; only I should like to put a good <unk> on .
Time , time ; if I but only had the time , I could turn him out as <unk> a leg now as ever ( _ sneezes _ ) <unk> to a lady in a parlor .
Those <unk> legs and calves of legs I ’ ve seen in <unk> windows wouldn ’ t compare at all .
They <unk> water , they do ; and of course get <unk> , and have to be <unk> ( _ sneezes _ ) with <unk> and <unk> , just like live legs .
There ; before I saw it off , now , I must call his old <unk> , and see whether the length will be all right ; too short , if anything , I guess .
Ha !
that ’ s the heel ; we are in luck ; here he comes , or it ’ s somebody else , that ’ s certain .
<unk> ( _ advancing _ ) .
( _ During the <unk> scene , the carpenter <unk> <unk> at times . _ ) Well , <unk> !
Just in time , sir .
If the captain <unk> , I will now mark the length .
Let me measure , sir .
<unk> for a leg !
good .
Well , it ’ s not the first time .
About it !
There ; keep thy finger on it .
This is a cogent vice thou hast here , carpenter ; let me feel its <unk> once .
So , so ; it does <unk> some .
Oh , sir , it will break bones — beware , beware !
No fear ; I like a good <unk> ; I like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold , man .
What ’ s <unk> about there ? — the blacksmith , I mean — what ’ s he about ?
He must be <unk> the <unk> , sir , now .
Right .
It ’ s a <unk> ; he <unk> the <unk> part .
He makes a fierce red flame there !
Aye , sir ; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work .
<unk> .
So he must .
I do <unk> it now a most meaning thing , that that old Greek , <unk> , who made men , they say , should have been a blacksmith , and animated them with fire ; for what ’ s made in fire must properly belong to fire ; and so hell ’ s probable .
How the <unk> flies !
This must be the <unk> the Greek made the <unk> of .
Carpenter , when he ’ s through with that <unk> , tell him to forge a pair of steel <unk> ; there ’ s a <unk> aboard with a <unk> pack .
Sir ?
Hold ; while <unk> is about it , I ’ ll order a complete man after a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , fifty feet high in his socks ; then , chest <unk> after the <unk> <unk> ; then , legs with <unk> to ’ em , to stay in one place ; then , arms three feet through the wrist ; no heart at all , <unk> forehead , and about a quarter of an <unk> of fine brains ; and let me see — shall I order eyes to see <unk> ?
No , but put a <unk> on top of his head to <unk> <unk> .
There , take the order , and away .
Now , what ’ s he speaking about , and who ’ s he speaking to , I should like to know ?
Shall I keep standing here ?
( _ aside _ ) .
’ Tis but indifferent <unk> to make a blind <unk> ; here ’ s one .
No , no , no ; I must have a lantern .
Ho , ho !
That ’ s it , hey ?
Here are two , sir ; one will serve my turn .
What art thou thrusting that <unk> into my face for , man ?
<unk> light is worse than presented <unk> .
I thought , sir , that you spoke to carpenter .
Carpenter ?
why that ’ s — but no ; — a very <unk> , and , I may say , an <unk> <unk> sort of business thou art in here , carpenter ; — or would ’ st thou rather work in clay ?
Sir ? — <unk> ?
clay , sir ?
That ’ s <unk> ; we leave clay to <unk> , sir .
The fellow ’ s impious !
What art thou <unk> about ?
<unk> is rather <unk> , sir .
Take the hint , then ; and when thou art dead , never bury thyself under living people ’ s noses .
Sir ? — oh !
ah ! — I guess so ; — yes — oh , dear !
Look ye , carpenter , I dare say thou <unk> thyself a right good <unk> <unk> , eh ?
Well , then , will it speak <unk> well for thy work , if , when I come to mount this leg thou <unk> , I shall nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it ; that is , carpenter , my old lost leg ; the flesh and blood one , I mean .
<unk> thou not drive that old Adam away ?
<unk> , sir , I begin to understand somewhat now .
Yes , I have heard something curious on that score , sir ; how that a dismasted man never entirely <unk> the feeling of his old spar , but it will be still <unk> him at times .
May I <unk> ask if it be really so , sir ?
It is , man .
Look , put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was ; so , now , here is only one distinct leg to the eye , yet two to the soul .
Where thou <unk> <unk> life ; there , exactly there , there to a hair , do I. Is ’ t a <unk> ?
I should <unk> call it a <unk> , sir .
Hist , then .
How dost thou know that some entire , living , thinking thing may not be <unk> and <unk> standing precisely where thou now <unk> ; aye , and standing there in thy spite ?
In thy most solitary hours , then , dost thou not fear <unk> ?
Hold , don ’ t speak !
And if I still feel the <unk> of my crushed leg , though it be now so long <unk> ; then , why <unk> not thou , carpenter , feel the fiery pains of hell for ever , and without a body ?
<unk> !
Good Lord !
<unk> , sir , if it comes to that , I must <unk> over again ; I think I didn ’ t carry a small figure , sir .
Look ye , <unk> should never <unk> <unk> . — How long before the leg is done ?
Perhaps an hour , sir .
<unk> away at it then , and bring it to me ( _ turns to go _ ) .
Oh , Life !
Here I am , proud as Greek god , and yet standing <unk> to this <unk> for a bone to stand on !
<unk> be that mortal <unk> which will not do away with <unk> .
I would be free as air ; and I ’ m down in the whole world ’ s books .
I am so rich , I could have given bid for bid with the <unk> <unk> at the <unk> of the Roman <unk> ( which was the world ’ s ) ; and yet I <unk> for the flesh in the tongue I <unk> with .
By heavens !
I ’ ll get a <unk> , and into it , and <unk> myself down to one small , <unk> <unk> .
So .
<unk> ( _ resuming his work _ ) .
Well , well , well !
Stubb knows him best of all , and Stubb always says he ’ s queer ; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer ; he ’ s queer , says Stubb ; he ’ s queer — queer , queer ; and keeps <unk> it into Mr. Starbuck all the time — queer — sir — queer , queer , very queer .
And here ’ s his leg !
Yes , now that I think of it , here ’ s his bedfellow !
has a stick of whale ’ s <unk> for a wife !
And this is his leg ; he ’ ll stand on this .
What was that now about one leg standing in three places , and all three places standing in one hell — how was that ?
Oh !
I don ’ t wonder he looked so <unk> at me !
I ’ m a sort of <unk> sometimes , they say ; but that ’ s only <unk> .
Then , a short , little old body like me , should never <unk> to <unk> out into deep waters with tall , <unk> captains ; the water <unk> you under the chin pretty quick , and there ’ s a great cry for <unk> .
And here ’ s the <unk> ’ s leg !
long and <unk> , sure enough !
Now , for most <unk> one pair of legs <unk> a lifetime , and that must be because they use them <unk> , as a <unk> old lady uses her <unk> old <unk> .
But Ahab ; oh he ’ s a hard <unk> .
Look , driven one leg to death , and <unk> the other for life , and now wears out bone legs by the cord .
Halloa , there , you <unk> !
bear a hand there with those <unk> , and let ’ s <unk> it before the resurrection fellow comes <unk> with his horn for all legs , true or false , as <unk> go round <unk> old beer barrels , to fill ’ em up again .
What a leg this is !
It looks like a real live leg , <unk> down to nothing but the <unk> ; he ’ ll be standing on this to-morrow ; he ’ ll be taking <unk> on it .
Halloa !
I almost <unk> the little <unk> <unk> , <unk> ivory , where he figures up the latitude .
So , so ; <unk> , file , and <unk> , now !
CHAPTER <unk> .
Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin .
According to usage they were <unk> the ship next morning ; and lo !
no <unk> oil came up with the water ; the casks below must have sprung a bad leak .
Much concern was shown ; and Starbuck went down into the cabin to report this <unk> affair .
* * In <unk> with any considerable quantity of oil on board , it is a regular <unk> duty to conduct a <unk> into the hold , and <unk> the casks with <unk> ; which afterwards , at <unk> intervals , is removed by the ship ’ s pumps .
<unk> the casks are sought to be kept <unk> tight ; while by the changed character of the withdrawn water , the mariners readily <unk> any serious <unk> in the precious <unk> .
Now , from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , between which lies one of the tropical <unk> from the China waters into the Pacific .
And so Starbuck found Ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him ; and another separate one representing the long <unk> coasts of the Japanese islands — <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
With his snow-white new ivory leg <unk> against the screwed leg of his table , and with a long <unk> of a jack-knife in his hand , the wondrous old man , with his back to the gangway door , was <unk> his brow , and <unk> his old courses again .
“ Who ’ s there ? ” hearing the <unk> at the door , but not turning round to it .
“ On deck !
<unk> ! ” “ Captain Ahab <unk> ; it is I.
The oil in the hold is <unk> , sir .
We must up <unk> and break out . ” “ Up <unk> and break out ?
Now that we are <unk> Japan ; <unk> here for a week to <unk> a parcel of old hoops ? ” “ <unk> do that , sir , or <unk> in one day more oil than we may make good in a year .
What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth <unk> , sir . ” “ So it is , so it is ; if we get it . ” “ I was speaking of the oil in the hold , sir . ” “ And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all .
<unk> !
Let it leak !
I ’ m all <unk> myself .
Aye !
<unk> in <unk> !
not only full of leaky casks , but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship ; and that ’ s a far worse plight than the Pequod ’ s , man .
Yet I don ’ t stop to <unk> my leak ; for who can find it in the <unk> hull ; or how hope to <unk> it , even if found , in this life ’ s howling gale ?
Starbuck !
I ’ ll not have the <unk> hoisted . ” “ What will the owners say , sir ? ” “ Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and <unk> the <unk> .
What <unk> Ahab ?
<unk> , owners ?
Thou art always <unk> to me , Starbuck , about those <unk> owners , as if the owners were my conscience .
But look ye , the only real owner of anything is its commander ; and <unk> ye , my conscience is in this ship ’ s keel . — On deck ! ” “ Captain Ahab , ” said the <unk> mate , moving further into the cabin , with a daring so strangely <unk> and <unk> that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward <unk> of itself , but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself ; “ A better man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough <unk> in a <unk> man ; aye , and in a <unk> , Captain Ahab . ” “ <unk> !
Dost thou then so much as dare to <unk> think of me ? — On deck ! ” “ Nay , sir , not yet ; I do <unk> .
And I do dare , sir — to be <unk> !
Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto , Captain Ahab ? ” Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack ( forming part of most <unk> ’ s cabin furniture ) , and pointing it towards Starbuck , exclaimed : “ There is one God that is Lord over the earth , and one Captain that is lord over the Pequod . — On deck ! ” For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate , and his fiery cheeks , you would have almost thought that he had really received the <unk> of the levelled tube .
But , <unk> his emotion , he half calmly rose , and as he quitted the cabin , paused for an instant and said : “ Thou hast <unk> , not <unk> me , sir ; but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck ; thou <unk> but laugh ; but let Ahab beware of Ahab ; beware of thyself , old man . ” “ He <unk> brave , but nevertheless <unk> ; most careful <unk> that ! ” murmured Ahab , as Starbuck disappeared .
“ What ’ s that he said — Ahab beware of Ahab — there ’ s something there ! ” Then unconsciously using the musket for a staff , with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin ; but presently the thick <unk> of his forehead <unk> , and returning the gun to the rack , he went to the deck .
“ Thou art but too good a fellow , Starbuck , ” he said lowly to the mate ; then raising his voice to the crew : “ <unk> the t ’ <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> , fore and aft ; back the <unk> ; up <unk> , and break out in the <unk> . ” It were perhaps vain to <unk> exactly why it was , that as <unk> Starbuck , Ahab thus <unk> .
It may have been a flash of <unk> in him ; or mere <unk> policy which , under the circumstance , <unk> forbade the slightest <unk> of open <unk> , however <unk> , in the important chief officer of his ship .
However it was , his orders were <unk> ; and the <unk> were hoisted .
CHAPTER <unk> .
Queequeg in His Coffin .
Upon <unk> , it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were perfectly sound , and that the leak must be further off .
So , it being calm weather , they broke out deeper and deeper , <unk> the <unk> of the huge <unk> butts ; and from that black midnight sending those gigantic <unk> into the daylight above .
So deep did they go ; and so ancient , and <unk> , and <unk> the aspect of the <unk> <unk> , that you almost looked next for some mouldy <unk> cask containing coins of Captain Noah , with copies of the posted <unk> , vainly warning the <unk> old world from the flood .
<unk> after tierce , too , of water , and bread , and beef , and <unk> of <unk> , and iron <unk> of hoops , were hoisted out , till at last the piled decks were hard to get about ; and the hollow hull <unk> under foot , as if you were <unk> over empty <unk> , and reeled and rolled in the sea like an <unk> <unk> .
<unk> was the ship as a <unk> <unk> with all <unk> in his head .
Well was it that the <unk> did not visit them then .
Now , at this time it was that my poor pagan <unk> , and fast <unk> , Queequeg , was seized with a <unk> , which brought him nigh to his endless end .
Be it said , that in this vocation of whaling , <unk> are unknown ; dignity and danger go hand in hand ; till you get to be Captain , the higher you rise the <unk> you toil .
So with poor Queequeg , who , as harpooneer , must not only face all the rage of the living whale , but — as we have elsewhere seen — mount his dead back in a rolling sea ; and finally descend into the gloom of the hold , and <unk> <unk> all day in that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> the <unk> casks and see to their <unk> .
To be short , among whalemen , the harpooneers are the <unk> , so called .
Poor Queequeg !
when the ship was about half <unk> , you should have stooped over the hatchway , and peered down upon him there ; where , stripped to his woollen drawers , the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that <unk> and <unk> , like a green <unk> <unk> at the bottom of a well .
And a well , or an <unk> , it somehow proved to him , poor pagan ; where , strange to say , for all the heat of his <unk> , he caught a terrible <unk> which <unk> into a <unk> ; and at last , after some days ’ suffering , laid him in his hammock , close to the very <unk> of the door of death .
How he wasted and wasted away in those few <unk> days , till there seemed but little left of him but his <unk> and tattooing .
But as all else in him <unk> , and his <unk> grew <unk> , his eyes , nevertheless , seemed growing <unk> and <unk> ; they became of a strange <unk> of <unk> ; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his <unk> , a wondrous <unk> to that immortal health in him which could not die , or be <unk> .
And like circles on the water , which , as they grow <unk> , expand ; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding , like the rings of <unk> .
An awe that cannot be named would <unk> over you as you sat by the side of this <unk> savage , and saw as strange things in his face , as any beheld who were <unk> when <unk> died .
For whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man , never yet was put into words or books .
And the drawing near of Death , which alike <unk> all , alike <unk> all with a last <unk> , which only an author from the dead could adequately tell .
So that — let us say it again — no dying <unk> or Greek had higher and <unk> thoughts than those , whose mysterious shades you saw <unk> over the face of poor Queequeg , as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock , and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest , and the ocean ’ s invisible <unk> lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven .
Not a man of the crew but gave him up ; and , as for Queequeg himself , what he thought of his case was <unk> shown by a curious <unk> he asked .
He called one to him in the grey morning watch , when the day was just breaking , and taking his hand , said that while in Nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood , like the rich <unk> of his native isle ; and upon inquiry , he had learned that all whalemen who died in Nantucket , were laid in those same dark canoes , and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him ; for it was not unlike the custom of his own race , who , after <unk> a dead warrior , stretched him out in his canoe , and so left him to be floated away to the <unk> archipelagoes ; for not only do they believe that the stars are isles , but that far beyond all visible <unk> , their own mild , <unk> seas , <unk> with the blue heavens ; and so form the white breakers of the milky way .
He added , that he <unk> at the thought of being buried in his hammock , according to the usual <unk> , tossed like something vile to the <unk> sharks .
No : he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket , all the more congenial to him , being a whaleman , that like a whale-boat these <unk> were without a keel ; though that involved but uncertain steering , and much <unk> <unk> the dim ages .
Now , when this strange circumstance was made known aft , the carpenter was at once commanded to do Queequeg ’ s bidding , whatever it might include .
There was some heathenish , <unk> old <unk> aboard , which , upon a long previous voyage , had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the <unk> islands , and from these dark planks the coffin was <unk> to be made .
No sooner was the carpenter <unk> of the order , than taking his rule , he <unk> with all the indifferent <unk> of his character , proceeded into the forecastle and took Queequeg ’ s measure with great <unk> , regularly <unk> Queequeg ’ s person as he shifted the rule .
“ Ah !
poor fellow !
he ’ ll have to die now , ” <unk> the Long Island sailor .
Going to his <unk> , the carpenter for <unk> sake and general reference , now <unk> measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be , and then made the <unk> permanent by cutting two <unk> at its <unk> .
This done , he <unk> the planks and his <unk> , and to work .
When the last nail was driven , and the lid duly <unk> and fitted , he lightly <unk> the coffin and went forward with it , inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction .
<unk> the <unk> but <unk> cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away , Queequeg , to every one ’ s consternation , commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him , nor was there any <unk> him ; seeing that , of all mortals , some dying men are the most <unk> ; and certainly , since they will shortly trouble us so little for <unk> , the poor fellows ought to be <unk> .
<unk> over in his hammock , Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an <unk> eye .
He then called for his harpoon , had the wooden stock drawn from it , and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the <unk> of his boat .
All by his own request , also , <unk> were then ranged round the sides within : a <unk> of fresh water was placed at the head , and a small bag of <unk> earth <unk> up in the hold at the foot ; and a piece of <unk> being rolled up for a pillow , Queequeg now <unk> to be lifted into his final bed , that he might make <unk> of its <unk> , if any it had .
He lay without moving a few minutes , then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god , Yojo .
Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between , he called for the coffin lid ( hatch he called it ) to be placed over him .
The head part turned over with a leather <unk> , and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but his <unk> countenance in view .
“ <unk> ” ( it will do ; it is easy ) , he murmured at last , and signed to be <unk> in his hammock .
But ere this was done , Pip , who had been <unk> hovering near by all this while , drew nigh to him where he lay , and with soft <unk> , took him by the hand ; in the other , holding his tambourine .
“ Poor <unk> !
will ye never have done with all this weary <unk> ?
where go ye now ?
But if the currents carry ye to those sweet <unk> where the <unk> are only beat with <unk> , will ye do one little errand for me ?
<unk> out one Pip , who ’ s now been missing long : I think he ’ s in those far <unk> .
If ye find him , then comfort him ; for he must be very sad ; for look !
he ’ s left his tambourine behind ; — I found it .
<unk> , dig , dig !
Now , Queequeg , die ; and I ’ ll beat ye your dying march . ” “ I have heard , ” murmured Starbuck , gazing down the scuttle , “ that in violent <unk> , men , all ignorance , have talked in ancient <unk> ; and that when the mystery is <unk> , it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten <unk> those ancient <unk> had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty <unk> .
So , to my fond faith , poor Pip , in this strange <unk> of his <unk> , <unk> heavenly <unk> of all our heavenly <unk> .
Where learned he that , but there ? — Hark !
he <unk> again : but more wildly now . ” “ <unk> two and two !
Let ’ s make a General of him !
Ho , where ’ s his harpoon ?
Lay it across here . — <unk> , dig , dig !
<unk> !
Oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow !
Queequeg dies game ! — mind ye that ; Queequeg dies game ! — take ye good heed of that ; Queequeg dies game !
I say ; game , game , game !
but base little Pip , he died a coward ; died all a ’ shiver ; — out upon Pip !
Hark ye ; if ye find Pip , tell all the <unk> he ’ s a <unk> ; a coward , a coward , a coward !
Tell them he jumped from a whale-boat !
I ’ d never beat my tambourine over base Pip , and hail him General , if he were once more dying here .
No , no !
<unk> upon all cowards — <unk> upon them !
Let ’ em go drown like Pip , that jumped from a whale-boat .
<unk> !
<unk> ! ” During all this , Queequeg lay with closed eyes , as if in a dream .
Pip was led away , and the sick man was <unk> in his hammock .
But now that he had apparently made every <unk> for death ; now that his coffin was proved a good fit , Queequeg suddenly <unk> ; soon there seemed no need of the carpenter ’ s box : and <unk> , when some expressed their <unk> surprise , he , in substance , said , that the cause of his sudden <unk> was this ; — at a critical moment , he had just recalled a little duty ashore , which he was leaving <unk> ; and therefore had changed his mind about dying : he could not die yet , he <unk> .
They asked him , then , whether to live or die was a matter of his own <unk> will and <unk> .
He answered , certainly .
In a word , it was Queequeg ’ s conceit , that if a man made up his mind to live , mere <unk> could not kill him : nothing but a whale , or a gale , or some violent , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of that sort .
Now , there is this <unk> difference between savage and civilized ; that while a sick , civilized man may be six months <unk> , generally speaking , a sick savage is almost <unk> again in a day .
So , in good time my Queequeg gained strength ; and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days ( but eating with a vigorous <unk> ) he suddenly leaped to his feet , threw out his arms and legs , gave himself a good stretching , <unk> a little bit , and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat , and <unk> a harpoon , pronounced himself fit for a fight .
With a wild <unk> , he now used his coffin for a <unk> ; and <unk> into it his canvas bag of clothes , set them in order there .
Many spare hours he spent , in carving the lid with all manner of <unk> figures and <unk> ; and it seemed that hereby he was striving , in his rude way , to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body .
And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and <unk> of his island , who , by those <unk> marks , had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth , and a mystical <unk> on the art of attaining truth ; so that Queequeg in his own proper person was a <unk> to <unk> ; a wondrous work in one volume ; but whose mysteries not even himself could read , though his own live heart beat against them ; and these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to <unk> away with the living <unk> <unk> they were <unk> , and so be <unk> to the last .
And this thought it must have been which <unk> to Ahab that wild exclamation of his , when one morning turning away from <unk> poor Queequeg — “ Oh , devilish <unk> of the gods ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The Pacific .
When gliding by the <unk> isles we emerged at last upon the great South Sea ; were it not for other things , I could have <unk> my dear Pacific with <unk> <unk> , for now the long <unk> of my youth was answered ; that serene ocean rolled <unk> from me a thousand leagues of blue .
There is , one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea , whose gently awful <unk> seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath ; like those <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> over the buried <unk> St. John .
And meet it is , that over these <unk> , <unk> watery <unk> and <unk> ’ <unk> of all four <unk> , the waves should rise and fall , and <unk> and flow <unk> ; for here , millions of mixed shades and shadows , drowned dreams , <unk> , reveries ; all that we call lives and souls , lie dreaming , dreaming , still ; tossing like <unk> in their <unk> ; the <unk> waves but made so by their <unk> .
To any <unk> <unk> <unk> , this serene Pacific , once beheld , must ever after be the sea of his <unk> .
It rolls the <unk> waters of the world , the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms .
The same waves <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> towns , but yesterday planted by the <unk> race of men , and <unk> the faded but still <unk> <unk> of <unk> lands , <unk> than <unk> ; while all between float <unk> of coral isles , and <unk> , endless , unknown <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
Thus this mysterious , divine Pacific <unk> the world ’ s whole bulk about ; makes all coasts one bay to it ; seems the <unk> heart of earth .
<unk> by those eternal swells , you needs must own the <unk> god , bowing your head to <unk> .
But few thoughts of <unk> stirred Ahab ’ s brain , as standing like an iron <unk> at his accustomed place beside the <unk> rigging , with one <unk> he <unk> snuffed the <unk> musk from the <unk> isles ( in whose sweet woods mild <unk> must be walking ) , and with the other <unk> <unk> the salt breath of the new found sea ; that sea in which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming .
<unk> at length upon these almost final waters , and gliding towards the Japanese cruising-ground , the old man ’ s purpose <unk> itself .
His firm lips met like the lips of a vice ; the <unk> of his forehead ’ s veins swelled like <unk> <unk> ; in his very sleep , his ringing cry ran through the <unk> hull , “ Stern all !
the White Whale spouts thick blood ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
<unk> himself of the mild , <unk> weather that now reigned in these latitudes , and in <unk> for the peculiarly active <unk> shortly to be <unk> , Perth , the <unk> , <unk> old blacksmith , had not removed his <unk> forge to the hold again , after concluding his <unk> work for Ahab ’ s leg , but still retained it on deck , fast lashed to <unk> by the <unk> ; being now almost <unk> <unk> by the headsmen , and harpooneers , and <unk> to do some little job for them ; <unk> , or <unk> , or new <unk> their various weapons and boat furniture .
Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle , all <unk> to be served ; holding <unk> , <unk> , harpoons , and lances , and <unk> watching his every <unk> movement , as he toiled .
Nevertheless , this old man ’ s was a patient hammer <unk> by a patient arm .
No <unk> , no impatience , no <unk> did come from him .
<unk> , slow , and solemn ; bowing over still further his <unk> broken back , he toiled away , as if toil were life itself , and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart .
And so it was . — Most miserable !
A peculiar walk in this old man , a certain slight but <unk> <unk> <unk> in his <unk> , had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariners .
And to the <unk> of their <unk> <unk> he had finally given in ; and so it came to pass that every one now knew the <unk> story of his wretched fate .
<unk> , and not <unk> , one bitter winter ’ s midnight , on the road running between two country towns , the blacksmith <unk> felt the deadly <unk> <unk> over him , and sought refuge in a leaning , <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> was , the loss of the <unk> of both feet .
Out of this <unk> , part by part , at last came out the four <unk> of the <unk> , and the one long , and as yet <unk> fifth act of the grief of his life ’ s <unk> .
He was an old man , who , at the age of nearly sixty , had <unk> encountered that thing in sorrow ’ s <unk> called ruin .
He had been an <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and with plenty to do ; owned a house and garden ; embraced a <unk> , <unk> , loving wife , and three <unk> , <unk> children ; every Sunday went to a <unk> church , planted in a <unk> .
But one night , under cover of darkness , and further <unk> in a most cunning <unk> , a desperate <unk> slid into his happy home , and <unk> them all of everything .
And darker yet to tell , the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this <unk> into his family ’ s heart .
It was the <unk> <unk> !
Upon the opening of that fatal <unk> , forth flew the fiend , and <unk> up his home .
Now , for prudent , most wise , and <unk> reasons , the blacksmith ’ s <unk> was in the <unk> of his <unk> , but with a separate entrance to it ; so that always had the young and loving healthy wife <unk> with no <unk> <unk> , but with vigorous <unk> , to the stout ringing of her <unk> old <unk> ’ s hammer ; whose <unk> , muffled by passing through the <unk> and walls , came up to her , not <unk> , in her <unk> ; and so , to stout <unk> ’ s iron <unk> , the blacksmith ’ s infants were rocked to <unk> .
Oh , woe on woe !
Oh , Death , why canst thou not sometimes be <unk> ?
<unk> thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him , then had the young widow had a <unk> grief , and her orphans a truly venerable , <unk> <unk> to dream of in their after years ; and all of them a <unk> <unk> .
But Death <unk> down some <unk> <unk> brother , on whose <unk> daily toil solely hung the <unk> of some other family , and left the worse than useless old man standing , till the hideous <unk> of life should make him <unk> to <unk> .
Why tell the whole ?
The blows of the <unk> hammer every day grew more and more between ; and each blow every day grew <unk> than the last ; the wife sat frozen at the window , with <unk> eyes , <unk> gazing into the <unk> faces of her children ; the <unk> fell ; the forge <unk> up with <unk> ; the house was <unk> ; the mother dived down into the long <unk> grass ; her children twice followed her thither ; and the <unk> , <unk> old man <unk> off a <unk> in <unk> ; his every woe <unk> ; his grey head a scorn to <unk> <unk> !
Death seems the only <unk> <unk> for a career like this ; but Death is only a <unk> into the region of the strange <unk> ; it is but the first <unk> to the <unk> of the immense <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> ; therefore , to the <unk> eyes of such men , who still have left in them some interior <unk> against <unk> , does the <unk> and <unk> ocean <unk> spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable , taking terrors , and wonderful , <unk> adventures ; and from the hearts of infinite <unk> , the thousand <unk> sing to them — “ Come hither , <unk> ; here is another life without the <unk> of <unk> death ; here are wonders supernatural , without dying for them .
Come hither !
bury thyself in a life which , to your now equally <unk> and <unk> , landed world , is more <unk> than death .
Come hither !
put up _ thy _ <unk> , too , within the <unk> , and come hither , till we <unk> thee ! ” <unk> to these voices , East and West , by early sunrise , and by fall of eve , the blacksmith ’ s soul <unk> , Aye , I come !
And so Perth went a-whaling .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
With <unk> beard , and <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> , about <unk> , Perth was standing between his forge and anvil , the latter placed upon an <unk> log , with one hand holding a <unk> in the coals , and with the other at his forge ’ s lungs , when Captain Ahab came along , carrying in his hand a small <unk> leathern bag .
While yet a little distance from the forge , moody Ahab paused ; till at last , Perth , withdrawing his iron from the fire , began <unk> it upon the anvil — the red mass sending off the <unk> in thick hovering <unk> , some of which flew close to Ahab .
“ Are these thy <unk> <unk> ’ s <unk> , Perth ?
they are always flying in thy wake ; birds of good omen , too , but not to all ; — look here , they burn ; but thou — thou <unk> ’ st among them without a <unk> . ” “ Because I am scorched all over , Captain Ahab , ” answered Perth , resting for a moment on his hammer ; “ I am past scorching ; not easily can ’ st thou <unk> a scar . ” “ Well , well ; no more .
Thy <unk> voice sounds too calmly , <unk> <unk> to me .
In no Paradise myself , I am impatient of all <unk> in others that is not mad .
Thou should ’ st go mad , blacksmith ; say , why dost thou not go mad ?
How can ’ st thou endure without being mad ?
Do the heavens yet hate thee , that thou can ’ st not go mad ? — What <unk> thou making there ? ” “ <unk> an old <unk> , sir ; there were seams and dents in it . ” “ And can ’ st thou make it all smooth again , blacksmith , after such hard usage as it had ? ” “ I think so , sir . ” “ And I suppose thou can ’ st <unk> almost any seams and dents ; never mind how hard the <unk> , blacksmith ? ” “ Aye , sir , I think I can ; all seams and dents but one . ” “ Look ye here , then , ” cried Ahab , <unk> advancing , and leaning with both hands on Perth ’ s shoulders ; “ look ye here — _ here _ — can ye <unk> out a <unk> like this , blacksmith , ” sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow ; “ if thou could ’ st , blacksmith , glad enough would I lay my head upon thy anvil , and feel thy <unk> hammer between my eyes .
<unk> !
Can ’ st thou <unk> this <unk> ? ” “ Oh !
that is the one , sir !
<unk> I not all seams and dents but one ? ” “ Aye , blacksmith , it is the one ; aye , man , it is <unk> ; for though thou only see ’ st it here in my flesh , it has worked down into the bone of my skull — _ that _ is all wrinkles !
But , away with child ’ s play ; no more <unk> and <unk> to-day .
Look ye here ! ” <unk> the leathern bag , as if it were full of gold coins .
“ I , too , want a harpoon made ; one that a thousand <unk> of fiends could not part , Perth ; something that will stick in a whale like his own <unk> .
There ’ s the stuff , ” flinging the <unk> upon the anvil .
“ Look ye , blacksmith , these are the gathered <unk> of the steel shoes of <unk> horses . ” “ <unk> <unk> , sir ?
Why , Captain Ahab , thou hast here , then , the best and <unk> stuff we <unk> ever work . ” “ I know it , old man ; these <unk> will <unk> together like <unk> from the melted bones of murderers .
Quick !
forge me the harpoon .
And forge me first , twelve rods for its <unk> ; then wind , and <unk> , and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and <unk> of a tow-line .
Quick !
I ’ ll blow the fire . ” When at last the twelve rods were made , Ahab tried them , one by one , by <unk> them , with his own hand , round a long , heavy iron bolt .
“ A <unk> ! ” <unk> the last one .
“ <unk> that over again , Perth . ” This done , Perth was about to begin <unk> the twelve into one , when Ahab stayed his hand , and said he would <unk> his own iron .
As , then , with regular , <unk> <unk> , he hammered on the anvil , Perth passing to him the glowing rods , one after the other , and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame , the Parsee passed silently , and bowing over his head towards the fire , seemed <unk> some <unk> or some <unk> on the toil .
But , as Ahab looked up , he slid aside .
“ What ’ s that bunch of <unk> <unk> about there for ? ” muttered Stubb , looking on from the forecastle .
“ That Parsee smells fire like a <unk> ; and smells of it himself , like a hot musket ’ s <unk> . ” At last the <unk> , in one complete rod , received its final heat ; and as Perth , to <unk> it , plunged it all <unk> into the cask of water near by , the scalding steam shot up into Ahab ’ s bent face .
“ Would ’ st thou <unk> me , Perth ? ” <unk> for a moment with the <unk> ; “ have I been but <unk> my own <unk> , then ? ” “ <unk> God , not that ; yet I fear something , Captain Ahab .
Is not this harpoon for the White Whale ? ” “ For the white fiend !
But now for the barbs ; thou must make them thyself , man .
Here are my <unk> — the best of steel ; here , and make the barbs sharp as the <unk> of the <unk> Sea . ” For a moment , the old blacksmith eyed the <unk> as though he would fain not use them .
“ Take them , man , I have no need for them ; for I now neither <unk> , <unk> , nor pray till — but here — to work ! ” <unk> at last into an <unk> shape , and welded by Perth to the <unk> , the steel soon pointed the end of the iron ; and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat , prior to <unk> them , he cried to Ahab to place the <unk> near .
“ No , no — no water for that ; I want it of the true <unk> .
<unk> , there !
Tashtego , Queequeg , Daggoo !
What say ye , pagans !
Will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb ? ” holding it high up .
A <unk> of dark <unk> replied , Yes .
Three <unk> were made in the <unk> flesh , and the White Whale ’ s barbs were then <unk> .
“ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> in <unk> <unk> ! ” <unk> howled Ahab , as the <unk> iron <unk> <unk> the <unk> blood .
Now , <unk> the spare poles from below , and <unk> one of <unk> , with the <unk> still <unk> it , Ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron .
A coil of new tow-line was then <unk> , and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass , and stretched to a great <unk> .
<unk> his foot upon it , till the rope <unk> like a <unk> , then eagerly <unk> over it , and seeing no <unk> , Ahab exclaimed , “ Good !
and now for the <unk> . ” At one extremity the rope was <unk> , and the separate spread yarns were all <unk> and woven round the socket of the harpoon ; the pole was then driven hard up into the socket ; from the lower end the rope was <unk> <unk> along the pole ’ s length , and firmly secured so , with <unk> of twine .
This done , pole , iron , and rope — like the Three Fates — remained <unk> , and Ahab <unk> <unk> away with the weapon ; the sound of his ivory leg , and the sound of the <unk> pole , both <unk> ringing along every plank .
But ere he entered his cabin , light , unnatural , <unk> , yet most <unk> sound was heard .
Oh , Pip !
thy wretched laugh , thy <unk> but <unk> eye ; all thy strange <unk> not <unk> blended with the black <unk> of the melancholy ship , and <unk> it !
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
<unk> further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising ground , the Pequod was soon all <unk> in the fishery .
Often , in mild , pleasant weather , for twelve , fifteen , eighteen , and twenty hours on the stretch , they were engaged in the boats , steadily pulling , or sailing , or <unk> after the whales , or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising ; though with but small success for their pains .
At such times , under an <unk> sun ; afloat all day upon smooth , slow heaving swells ; seated in his boat , light as a <unk> canoe ; and so <unk> <unk> with the soft waves themselves , that like <unk> <unk> they <unk> against the gunwale ; these are the times of dreamy quietude , when beholding the <unk> beauty and <unk> of the ocean ’ s skin , one <unk> the tiger heart that <unk> beneath it ; and would not willingly remember , that this <unk> <unk> but <unk> a remorseless <unk> .
These are the times , when in his whale-boat the <unk> softly feels a certain <unk> , <unk> , <unk> feeling towards the sea ; that he <unk> it as so much <unk> earth ; and the distant ship revealing only the <unk> of her masts , seems struggling forward , not through high rolling waves , but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie : as when the western <unk> ’ horses only show their erected ears , while their hidden bodies widely <unk> through the amazing verdure .
The <unk> virgin <unk> ; the mild blue <unk> ; as over these there <unk> the <unk> , the hum ; you almost swear that <unk> children lie sleeping in these <unk> , in some glad <unk> , when the flowers of the woods are <unk> .
And all this <unk> with your most mystic mood ; so that fact and fancy , <unk> meeting , <unk> , and form one <unk> whole .
Nor did such <unk> scenes , however temporary , fail of at least as temporary an effect on Ahab .
But if these secret golden <unk> did seem to open in him his own secret golden <unk> , yet did his breath upon them prove but <unk> .
Oh , <unk> <unk> !
oh , ever <unk> endless <unk> in the soul ; in ye , — though long <unk> by the dead <unk> of the <unk> life , — in ye , men yet may roll , like young horses in new morning <unk> ; and for some few <unk> moments , feel the cool <unk> of the life immortal on them .
Would to God these blessed <unk> would last .
But the <unk> , <unk> threads of life are woven by warp and woof : <unk> crossed by storms , a storm for every calm .
There is no steady <unk> progress in this life ; we do not advance through fixed <unk> , and at the last one pause : — through infancy ’ s unconscious spell , <unk> ’ s <unk> faith , <unk> ’ doubt ( the common doom ) , then <unk> , then <unk> , resting at last in <unk> ’ s pondering repose of If .
But once gone through , we trace the round again ; and are infants , boys , and men , and <unk> eternally .
Where lies the final harbor , whence we <unk> no more ?
In what <unk> <unk> sails the world , of which the <unk> will never weary ?
Where is the <unk> ’ s father hidden ?
Our souls are like those orphans whose <unk> mothers die in bearing them : the secret of our <unk> lies in their grave , and we must there to learn it .
And that same day , too , gazing far down from his boat ’ s side into that same golden sea , Starbuck lowly murmured : — “ <unk> <unk> , as ever <unk> saw in his young bride ’ s eye ! — Tell me not of thy <unk> sharks , and thy <unk> cannibal ways .
Let faith <unk> fact ; let fancy <unk> memory ; I look deep down and do believe . ” And Stubb , <unk> , with sparkling scales , leaped up in that same golden light : — “ I am Stubb , and Stubb has his history ; but here Stubb takes <unk> that he has always been jolly ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The Pequod Meets The Bachelor .
And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind , some few weeks after Ahab ’ s harpoon had been welded .
It was a Nantucket ship , the Bachelor , which had just <unk> in her last cask of oil , and bolted down her bursting hatches ; and now , in glad <unk> <unk> , was <unk> , though somewhat <unk> , sailing round among the <unk> ships on the ground , previous to pointing her prow for home .
The three men at her mast-head wore long <unk> of narrow red <unk> at their hats ; from the stern , a whale-boat was suspended , bottom down ; and hanging <unk> from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain .
<unk> , <unk> , and <unk> of all colours were flying from her rigging , on every side .
<unk> lashed in each of her three <unk> <unk> were two barrels of sperm ; above which , in her <unk> cross-trees , you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid ; and nailed to her main <unk> was a <unk> lamp .
As was afterwards learned , the Bachelor had met with the most surprising success ; all the more wonderful , for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish .
Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm , but additional <unk> casks had been <unk> for , from the ships she had met ; and these were <unk> along the deck , and in the captain ’ s and officers ’ <unk> .
Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into <unk> ; and the cabin <unk> <unk> off the broad head of an <unk> , lashed down to the floor for a <unk> .
In the forecastle , the sailors had actually <unk> and pitched their <unk> , and filled them ; it was humorously added , that the cook had clapped a head on his largest <unk> , and filled it ; that the steward had <unk> his spare <unk> and filled it ; that the harpooneers had headed the <unk> of their irons and filled them ; that indeed everything was filled with sperm , except the captain ’ s <unk> pockets , and those he reserved to thrust his hands into , in <unk> <unk> of his entire satisfaction .
As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod , the <unk> sound of enormous <unk> came from her forecastle ; and drawing still nearer , a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge <unk> , which , covered with the <unk> _ <unk> _ or stomach skin of the black fish , gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew .
On the quarter-deck , the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the <unk> girls who had <unk> with them from the <unk> <unk> ; while suspended in an <unk> boat , firmly secured aloft between the <unk> and mainmast , three Long Island <unk> , with glittering <unk> of whale ivory , were <unk> over the <unk> <unk> .
Meanwhile , others of the ship ’ s company were <unk> busy at the masonry of the try-works , from which the huge pots had been removed .
You would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed <unk> , such wild cries they raised , as the now useless <unk> and <unk> were being hurled into the sea .
Lord and master over all this scene , the captain stood erect on the ship ’ s elevated quarter-deck , so that the whole <unk> <unk> was full before him , and seemed merely <unk> for his own individual <unk> .
And Ahab , he too was standing on his quarter-deck , shaggy and black , with a stubborn gloom ; and as the two ships crossed each other ’ s wakes — one all <unk> for things passed , the other all <unk> as to things to come — their two captains in themselves <unk> the whole striking contrast of the scene .
“ Come aboard , come aboard ! ” cried the gay Bachelor ’ s commander , lifting a glass and a <unk> in the air .
“ Hast seen the White Whale ? ” <unk> Ahab in reply .
“ No ; only heard of him ; but don ’ t believe in him at all , ” said the other <unk> .
“ Come aboard ! ” “ Thou art too damned jolly .
Sail on .
Hast lost any men ? ” “ Not enough to speak of — two <unk> , that ’ s all ; — but come aboard , old hearty , come along .
I ’ ll soon take that black from your brow .
Come along , will ye ( merry ’ s the play ) ; a full ship and <unk> . ” “ How wondrous familiar is a fool ! ” muttered Ahab ; then <unk> , “ Thou art a full ship and homeward bound , thou <unk> ; well , then , call me an empty ship , and <unk> .
So go thy ways , and I will mine .
<unk> there !
<unk> all sail , and keep her to the wind ! ” And thus , while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze , the other <unk> fought against it ; and so the two vessels parted ; the crew of the Pequod looking with grave , lingering glances towards the <unk> Bachelor ; but the Bachelor ’ s men never <unk> their gaze for the lively revelry they were in .
And as Ahab , leaning over the taffrail , eyed the <unk> craft , he took from his pocket a small vial of sand , and then looking from the ship to the vial , seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together , for that vial was filled with Nantucket soundings .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> Whale .
Not seldom in this life , when , on the right side , <unk> ’ s <unk> sail close by us , we , though all <unk> before , catch somewhat of the rushing breeze , and <unk> feel our <unk> sails fill out .
So seemed it with the Pequod .
For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor , whales were seen and four were slain ; and one of them by Ahab .
It was far down the afternoon ; and when all the <unk> of the <unk> fight were done : and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky , sun and whale both <unk> died together ; then , such a <unk> and such <unk> , such <unk> <unk> curled up in that <unk> air , that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green <unk> valleys of the Manilla isles , the Spanish <unk> , <unk> turned sailor , had gone to sea , <unk> with these <unk> <unk> .
<unk> again , but only <unk> to deeper gloom , Ahab , who had <unk> off from the whale , sat intently watching his final <unk> from the now <unk> boat .
For that strange spectacle <unk> in all sperm whales dying — the turning <unk> of the head , and so <unk> — that strange spectacle , beheld of such a <unk> evening , somehow to Ahab conveyed a <unk> unknown before .
“ He turns and turns him to it , — how slowly , but how steadfastly , his <unk> and <unk> brow , with his last dying motions .
He too <unk> fire ; most faithful , broad , <unk> <unk> of the sun ! — Oh that these <unk> eyes should see these <unk> sights .
Look !
here , far <unk> ; beyond all hum of human <unk> or woe ; in these most <unk> and <unk> seas ; where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets ; where for long Chinese ages , the billows have still rolled on speechless and <unk> to , as stars that <unk> upon the <unk> ’ s unknown source ; here , too , life dies <unk> full of faith ; but see !
no sooner dead , than death <unk> round the corpse , and it heads some other way .
“ Oh , thou dark Hindoo half of nature , who of drowned bones hast <unk> thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these <unk> seas ; thou art an infidel , thou <unk> , and too truly <unk> to me in the <unk> Typhoon , and the <unk> <unk> of its after calm .
Nor has this thy whale <unk> turned his dying head , and then gone round again , without a lesson to me .
“ Oh , <unk> <unk> and welded <unk> of power !
Oh , high <unk> , <unk> jet ! — that one <unk> , this one <unk> all in vain !
In vain , oh whale , dost thou seek <unk> with yon <unk> sun , that only calls forth life , but gives it not again .
Yet dost thou , darker half , rock me with a <unk> , if a darker faith .
All thy <unk> <unk> float beneath me here ; I am <unk> by breaths of once living things , <unk> as air , but water now .
“ Then hail , for ever hail , O sea , in whose eternal <unk> the wild fowl finds his only rest .
<unk> of earth , yet <unk> by the sea ; though hill and valley <unk> me , ye billows are my <unk> ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The Whale Watch .
The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart ; one , far to windward ; one , less distant , to leeward ; one ahead ; one astern .
These last three were brought alongside ere <unk> ; but the windward one could not be reached till morning ; and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night ; and that boat was Ahab ’ s .
The <unk> was thrust upright into the dead whale ’ s spout-hole ; and the lantern hanging from its top , cast a troubled <unk> <unk> upon the black , <unk> back , and far out upon the midnight waves , which gently <unk> the whale ’ s broad flank , like soft surf upon a beach .
Ahab and all his boat ’ s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee ; who <unk> in the bow , sat watching the sharks , that <unk> <unk> round the whale , and <unk> the light cedar planks with their tails .
A sound like the <unk> in <unk> over <unk> of <unk> ghosts of <unk> , ran shuddering through the air .
<unk> from his <unk> , Ahab , face to face , saw the Parsee ; and <unk> round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a <unk> world .
“ I have <unk> it again , ” said he .
“ Of the <unk> ?
Have I not said , old man , that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine ? ” “ And who are <unk> that die on the sea ? ” “ But I said , old man , that ere thou <unk> die on this voyage , two <unk> must <unk> be seen by thee on the sea ; the first not made by mortal hands ; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in America . ” “ Aye , aye !
a strange sight that , Parsee : — a hearse and its <unk> floating over the ocean with the waves for the <unk> .
Ha !
Such a sight we shall not soon see . ” “ <unk> it or not , thou canst not die till it be seen , old man . ” “ And what was that saying about thyself ? ” “ Though it come to the last , I shall still go before thee thy pilot . ” “ And when thou art so gone before — if that ever <unk> — then ere I can follow , thou must still appear to me , to pilot me still ? — Was it not so ?
Well , then , did I believe all ye say , oh my pilot !
I have here two <unk> that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it . ” “ Take another <unk> , old man , ” said the Parsee , as his eyes lighted up like <unk> in the gloom — “ <unk> only can kill thee . ” “ The gallows , ye mean . — I am immortal then , on land and on sea , ” cried Ahab , with a laugh of <unk> ; — “ <unk> on land and on sea ! ” Both were silent again , as one man .
The grey dawn came on , and the <unk> crew <unk> from the boat ’ s bottom , and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
The season for the Line at length drew near ; and every day when Ahab , coming from his cabin , cast his eyes aloft , the <unk> helmsman would <unk> handle his <unk> , and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces , and would stand there with all their eyes <unk> fixed on the nailed doubloon ; impatient for the order to point the ship ’ s prow for the equator .
In good time the order came .
It was hard upon high noon ; and Ahab , seated in the bows of his <unk> boat , was about taking his <unk> daily observation of the sun to <unk> his latitude .
Now , in that Japanese sea , the days in summer are as <unk> of <unk> .
That <unk> vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing <unk> of the <unk> ocean ’ s <unk> <unk> .
The sky looks <unk> ; clouds there are none ; the horizon floats ; and this <unk> of <unk> <unk> is as the insufferable <unk> of God ’ s throne .
Well that Ahab ’ s quadrant was furnished with <unk> glasses , through which to take sight of that <unk> fire .
So , swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship , and with his <unk> <unk> placed to his eye , he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise <unk> .
Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed , the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship ’ s deck , and with face thrown up like Ahab ’ s , was eyeing the same sun with him ; only the <unk> of his eyes half hooded their <unk> , and his wild face was <unk> to an earthly <unk> .
At length the desired observation was taken ; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg , Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant .
Then falling into a moment ’ s <unk> , he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself : “ Thou <unk> !
thou high and mighty <unk> !
thou <unk> me truly where I _ am _ — but canst thou cast the least hint where I _ shall _ be ?
Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living ?
Where is Moby Dick ?
This instant thou must be eyeing him .
These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him ; aye , and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown , thither side of thee , thou sun ! ” Then gazing at his quadrant , and <unk> , one after the other , its numerous <unk> contrivances , he pondered again , and muttered : “ <unk> <unk> !
<unk> ’ <unk> of haughty <unk> , and <unk> , and Captains ; the world <unk> of thee , of thy cunning and might ; but what after all canst thou do , but tell the poor , <unk> point , where thou thyself <unk> to be on this wide <unk> , and the hand that holds thee : no !
not one jot more !
Thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one <unk> of sand will be to-morrow noon ; and yet with thy <unk> thou <unk> the sun !
<unk> !
<unk> thee , thou vain <unk> ; and cursed be all the things that cast man ’ s eyes aloft to that heaven , whose live <unk> but <unk> him , as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light , O sun !
<unk> by nature to this earth ’ s horizon are the glances of man ’ s eyes ; not shot from the crown of his head , as if God had meant him to gaze on his <unk> .
<unk> thee , thou quadrant ! ” dashing it to the deck , “ no longer will I <unk> my earthly way by thee ; the level ship ’ s compass , and the level <unk> , by log and by line ; _ these _ shall conduct me , and show me my place on the sea .
Aye , ” <unk> from the boat to the deck , “ thus I <unk> on thee , thou <unk> thing that <unk> <unk> on high ; thus I split and destroy thee ! ” As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus <unk> with his live and dead feet , a <unk> <unk> that seemed meant for Ahab , and a <unk> despair that seemed meant for himself — these passed over the <unk> , motionless Parsee ’ s face .
<unk> he rose and glided away ; while , <unk> by the aspect of their commander , the seamen <unk> together on the forecastle , till Ahab , <unk> pacing the deck , shouted out — “ To the braces !
Up helm ! — square in ! ” In an instant the yards swung round ; and as the ship <unk> upon her heel , her three <unk> <unk> masts <unk> <unk> upon her long , ribbed hull , seemed as the three <unk> <unk> on one sufficient steed .
Standing between the <unk> , Starbuck watched the Pequod ’ s tumultuous way , and Ahab ’ s also , as he went <unk> along the deck .
“ I have sat before the dense <unk> fire and watched it all <unk> , full of its tormented flaming life ; and I have seen it <unk> at last , down , down , to <unk> dust .
Old man of oceans !
of all this fiery life of thine , what will at length remain but one little <unk> of ashes ! ” “ Aye , ” cried Stubb , “ but <unk> ashes — mind ye that , Mr. Starbuck — <unk> , not your common <unk> .
Well , well ; I heard Ahab <unk> , ‘ Here some one <unk> these <unk> into these old hands of mine ; <unk> that I must play them , and no others . ’ And <unk> me , Ahab , but thou <unk> right ; live in the game , and die in it ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
<unk> climes but <unk> the <unk> <unk> : the tiger of <unk> <unk> in <unk> groves of <unk> verdure .
<unk> the most <unk> but basket the <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> knows <unk> that never swept tame northern lands .
So , too , it is , that in these <unk> Japanese seas the mariner <unk> the <unk> of all storms , the Typhoon .
It will sometimes burst from out that <unk> sky , like an <unk> <unk> upon a <unk> and sleepy town .
Towards evening of that day , the Pequod was torn of her canvas , and <unk> was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly ahead .
When darkness came on , sky and sea roared and split with the thunder , and <unk> with the lightning , that showed the <unk> masts <unk> here and there with the <unk> which the first fury of the tempest had left for its after <unk> .
<unk> by a shroud , Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck ; at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft , to see what additional <unk> might have <unk> the <unk> <unk> there ; while Stubb and Flask were <unk> the men in the higher hoisting and <unk> lashing of the boats .
But all their pains seemed naught .
Though lifted to the very top of the <unk> , the windward quarter boat ( Ahab ’ s ) did not escape .
A great rolling sea , dashing high up against the reeling ship ’ s high <unk> side , stove in the boat ’ s bottom at the stern , and left it again , all dripping through like a <unk> .
“ <unk> work , bad work !
Mr. Starbuck , ” said Stubb , regarding the wreck , “ but the sea will have its way .
Stubb , for one , can ’ t fight it .
You see , Mr. Starbuck , a wave has such a great long start before it leaps , all round the world it runs , and then comes the spring !
But as for me , all the start I have to meet it , is just across the deck here .
But never mind ; it ’ s all in fun : so the old song says ; ” — ( _ <unk> _ . )
Oh !
jolly is the gale , And a <unk> is the whale , A ’ <unk> ’ his tail , — Such a funny , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> lad , is the Ocean , oh !
The scud all a <unk> ’ , That ’ s his flip only <unk> ’ ; When he <unk> in the <unk> ’ , — Such a funny , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> lad , is the Ocean , oh !
Thunder <unk> the ships , But he only <unk> his lips , A <unk> ’ of this flip , — Such a funny , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> lad , is the Ocean , oh !
“ Avast Stubb , ” cried Starbuck , “ let the Typhoon sing , and strike his <unk> here in our rigging ; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy peace . ” “ But I am not a brave man ; never said I was a brave man ; I am a coward ; and I sing to keep up my spirits .
And I tell you what it is , Mr. Starbuck , there ’ s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat .
And when that ’ s done , ten to one I sing ye the <unk> for a <unk> . ” “ <unk> !
look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own . ” “ What !
how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else , never mind how foolish ? ” “ Here ! ” cried Starbuck , seizing Stubb by the shoulder , and pointing his hand towards the weather bow , “ <unk> thou not that the gale comes from the eastward , the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick ?
the very course he swung to this day noon ?
now mark his boat there ; where is that stove ?
In the <unk> , man ; where he is wont to stand — his <unk> is stove , man !
Now jump overboard , and sing away , if thou must !
“ I don ’ t half understand ye : what ’ s in the wind ? ” “ Yes , yes , round the Cape of Good Hope is the <unk> way to Nantucket , ” soliloquized Starbuck suddenly , <unk> of Stubb ’ s question .
“ The gale that now hammers at us to stave us , we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home .
<unk> , to windward , all is blackness of doom ; but to leeward , homeward — I see it <unk> up there ; but not with the lightning . ” At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness , following the flashes , a voice was heard at his side ; and almost at the same instant a <unk> of thunder <unk> rolled overhead .
“ Who ’ s there ? ” “ Old Thunder ! ” said Ahab , groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivot-hole ; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by <unk> lances of fire .
Now , as the lightning rod to a <unk> on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil ; so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast , is intended to conduct it into the water .
But as this <unk> must descend to considerable depth , that its end may avoid all contact with the hull ; and as moreover , if kept <unk> towing there , it would be <unk> to many <unk> , besides <unk> not a little with some of the rigging , and more or less <unk> the vessel ’ s way in the water ; because of all this , the lower parts of a ship ’ s <unk> are not always overboard ; but are generally made in long slender links , so as to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside , or thrown down into the sea , as occasion may require .
“ The rods !
the rods ! ” cried Starbuck to the crew , suddenly <unk> to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting <unk> , to light Ahab to his post .
“ Are they overboard ?
drop them over , fore and aft .
Quick ! ” “ Avast ! ” cried Ahab ; “ let ’ s have fair play here , though we be the <unk> side .
Yet I ’ ll <unk> to raise rods on the <unk> and Andes , that all the world may be secured ; but out on <unk> !
Let them be , sir . ” “ Look aloft ! ” cried Starbuck .
“ The corpusants !
the corpusants ! ” All the <unk> were <unk> with a <unk> fire ; and touched at each <unk> <unk> with three tapering white flames , each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that <unk> air , like three gigantic <unk> tapers before an altar .
“ Blast the boat !
let it go ! ” cried Stubb at this instant , as a <unk> sea heaved up under his own little craft , so that its gunwale violently <unk> his hand , as he was passing a lashing .
“ Blast it ! ” — but slipping backward on the deck , his uplifted eyes caught the flames ; and immediately <unk> his tone he cried — “ The corpusants have mercy on us all ! ” To sailors , <unk> are household words ; they will swear in the trance of the calm , and in the teeth of the tempest ; they will <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , when most they <unk> over to a <unk> sea ; but in all my <unk> , seldom have I heard a common oath when God ’ s burning finger has been laid on the ship ; when His “ <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ” has been woven into the shrouds and the <unk> .
While this <unk> was burning aloft , few words were heard from the enchanted crew ; who in one thick <unk> stood on the forecastle , all their eyes <unk> in that pale <unk> , like a far away <unk> of stars .
<unk> against the <unk> light , the gigantic jet negro , Daggoo , loomed up to thrice his real <unk> , and seemed the black <unk> from which the thunder had come .
The parted mouth of Tashtego revealed his <unk> teeth , which strangely gleamed as if they too had been <unk> by corpusants ; while <unk> up by the preternatural light , Queequeg ’ s tattooing burned like <unk> blue flames on his body .
The <unk> all <unk> at last with the <unk> aloft ; and once more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a <unk> .
A moment or two passed , when Starbuck , going forward , pushed against some one .
It was Stubb .
“ What <unk> thou now , man ; I heard thy cry ; it was not the same in the song . ” “ No , no , it wasn ’ t ; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all ; and I hope they will , still .
But do they only have mercy on long faces ? — have they no bowels for a laugh ?
And look ye , Mr. Starbuck — but it ’ s too dark to look .
<unk> me , then : I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign of good luck ; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be <unk> a ’ block with <unk> , d ’ ye see ; and so , all that sperm will work up into the masts , like <unk> in a tree .
Yes , our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti candles — that ’ s the good promise we saw . ” At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb ’ s face slowly beginning to <unk> into sight .
<unk> upwards , he cried : “ See !
see ! ” and once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed <unk> <unk> in their pallor .
“ The corpusants have mercy on us all , ” cried Stubb , again .
At the base of the mainmast , full beneath the doubloon and the flame , the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab ’ s front , but with his head bowed away from him ; while near by , from the arched and <unk> rigging , where they had just been engaged securing a spar , a number of the seamen , <unk> by the <unk> , now <unk> together , and hung <unk> , like a knot of <unk> <unk> from a drooping , <unk> <unk> .
In various enchanted attitudes , like the standing , or stepping , or running skeletons in <unk> , others remained rooted to the deck ; but all their eyes <unk> .
“ Aye , aye , men ! ” cried Ahab .
“ Look up at it ; mark it well ; the white flame but lights the way to the White Whale !
Hand me those mainmast links there ; I would fain feel this <unk> , and let mine beat against it ; blood against fire !
So . ” Then turning — the last <unk> held fast in his left hand , he put his foot upon the Parsee ; and with fixed upward eye , and <unk> right arm , he stood erect before the lofty <unk> <unk> of flames .
“ Oh !
thou clear spirit of clear fire , whom on these seas I as Persian once did worship , till in the <unk> act so burned by thee , that to this hour I bear the scar ; I now know thee , thou clear spirit , and I now know that thy right worship is <unk> .
To neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind ; and <unk> ’ <unk> for hate thou canst but kill ; and all are killed .
No fearless fool now <unk> thee .
I own thy speechless , <unk> power ; but to the last <unk> of my <unk> life will <unk> its unconditional , <unk> <unk> in me .
In the midst of the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> stands here .
Though but a point at best ; <unk> ’ er I came ; <unk> ’ er I go ; yet while I earthly live , the <unk> <unk> lives in me , and feels her royal rights .
But war is <unk> , and hate is woe .
Come in thy <unk> form of love , and I will <unk> and <unk> thee ; but at thy highest , come as mere <unk> power ; and though thou <unk> navies of <unk> worlds , there ’ s that in here that still remains indifferent .
Oh , thou clear spirit , of thy fire thou <unk> me , and like a true child of fire , I breathe it back to thee . ” <unk> _ <unk> , repeated flashes of lightning ; the nine flames leap lengthwise to thrice their previous height ; Ahab , with the rest , <unk> his eyes , his right hand pressed hard upon them . _ <unk> “ I own thy speechless , <unk> power ; said I not so ?
Nor was it <unk> from me ; nor do I now drop these links .
Thou canst blind ; but I can then <unk> .
Thou canst <unk> ; but I can then be ashes .
Take the homage of these poor eyes , and <unk> .
I would not take it .
The lightning flashes through my skull ; mine <unk> <unk> and <unk> ; my whole <unk> brain seems as beheaded , and rolling on some <unk> ground .
Oh , oh !
Yet <unk> , yet will I talk to thee .
<unk> though thou be , thou <unk> out of darkness ; but I am darkness leaping out of light , leaping out of thee !
The <unk> <unk> ; open eyes ; see , or not ?
There burn the flames !
Oh , thou <unk> !
now I do glory in my <unk> .
But thou art but my fiery father ; my sweet mother , I know not .
Oh , cruel !
what hast thou done with her ?
There lies my <unk> ; but thine is greater .
Thou knowest not how came ye , hence <unk> thyself <unk> ; certainly knowest not thy beginning , hence <unk> thyself <unk> .
I know that of me , which thou knowest not of thyself , oh , thou omnipotent .
There is some <unk> thing beyond thee , thou clear spirit , to whom all thy <unk> is but time , all thy <unk> mechanical .
Through thee , thy flaming self , my scorched eyes do dimly see it .
Oh , thou <unk> fire , thou <unk> immemorial , thou too hast thy <unk> <unk> , thy <unk> grief .
Here again with haughty agony , I read my <unk> .
<unk> !
leap up , and <unk> the sky !
I leap with thee ; I burn with thee ; would fain be welded with thee ; <unk> I worship thee ! ” “ The boat !
the boat ! ” cried Starbuck , “ look at thy boat , old man ! ” Ahab ’ s harpoon , the one forged at Perth ’ s fire , remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch , so that it <unk> beyond his whale-boat ’ s bow ; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather <unk> to drop off ; and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale , forked fire .
As the silent harpoon burned there like a <unk> ’ s tongue , Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm — “ God , God is against thee , old man ; <unk> !
’ tis an ill voyage !
ill <unk> , ill continued ; let me square the yards , while we may , old man , and make a fair wind of it <unk> , to go on a better voyage than this . ” <unk> Starbuck , the <unk> crew instantly ran to the braces — though not a sail was left aloft .
For the moment all the aghast mate ’ s thoughts seemed theirs ; they raised a half <unk> cry .
But dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck , and snatching the burning harpoon , Ahab waved it like a <unk> among them ; swearing to <unk> with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope ’ s end .
<unk> by his aspect , and still more <unk> from the fiery dart that he held , the men fell back in dismay , and Ahab again spoke : — “ All your <unk> to hunt the White Whale are as <unk> as mine ; and heart , soul , and body , lungs and life , old Ahab is bound .
And that ye may know to what <unk> this heart <unk> ; look ye here ; thus I blow out the last fear ! ” And with one blast of his breath he <unk> the flame .
As in the <unk> that <unk> the plain , men fly the <unk> of some lone , gigantic <unk> , whose very height and strength but render it so much the more <unk> , because so much the more a mark for <unk> ; so at those last words of Ahab ’ s many of the mariners did run from him in a terror of dismay .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Deck Towards the <unk> of the First <unk> Watch .
_ Ahab standing by the helm .
Starbuck approaching him . _ “ We must send down the <unk> yard , sir .
The band is working loose and the lee lift is <unk> .
Shall I strike it , sir ? ” “ Strike nothing ; lash it .
If I had <unk> poles , I ’ d sway them up now . ” “ Sir ! — in God ’ s name ! — sir ? ” “ Well . ” “ The anchors are working , sir .
Shall I get them <unk> ? ” “ Strike nothing , and <unk> nothing , but lash everything .
The wind rises , but it has not got up to my <unk> yet .
Quick , and see to it . — By masts and keels !
he takes me for the <unk> <unk> of some <unk> <unk> .
<unk> down my <unk> yard !
Ho , <unk> !
<unk> <unk> were made for <unk> winds , and this <unk> of mine now sails amid the <unk> .
Shall I strike that ?
Oh , none but cowards send down their <unk> in tempest time .
What a <unk> aloft there !
I would <unk> ’ <unk> take it for sublime , did I not know that the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
Oh , take <unk> , take <unk> ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
Midnight . — The Forecastle <unk> .
_ Stubb and Flask mounted on them , and passing additional <unk> over the anchors there hanging . _ “ No , Stubb ; you may pound that knot there as much as you please , but you will never pound into me what you were just now saying .
And how long ago is it since you said the very contrary ?
Didn ’ t you once say that whatever ship Ahab sails in , that ship should pay something extra on its <unk> policy , just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of <unk> forward ?
Stop , now ; didn ’ t you say so ? ” “ Well , suppose I did ?
What then ?
I ’ ve part changed my flesh since that time , why not my mind ?
Besides , <unk> we _ are _ loaded with powder barrels aft and <unk> forward ; how the devil could the <unk> get <unk> in this <unk> spray here ?
Why , my little man , you have pretty red hair , but you couldn ’ t get <unk> now .
<unk> yourself ; you ’ re <unk> , or the <unk> , Flask ; might fill <unk> at your coat <unk> .
Don ’ t you see , then , that for these extra <unk> the <unk> <unk> companies have extra <unk> ?
Here are <unk> , Flask .
But <unk> , again , and I ’ ll answer ye the other thing .
First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here , though , so I can pass the rope ; now listen .
What ’ s the mighty difference between holding a mast ’ s <unk> in the storm , and standing close by a mast that hasn ’ t got any <unk> at all in a storm ?
Don ’ t you see , you <unk> , that no harm can come to the holder of the rod , unless the mast is first struck ?
What are you talking about , then ?
Not one ship in a hundred carries rods , and Ahab , — aye , man , and all of us , — were in no more danger then , in my poor opinion , than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas .
Why , you King-Post , you , I suppose you would have every man in the world go about with a small <unk> running up the corner of his hat , like a <unk> officer ’ s <unk> <unk> , and <unk> behind like his <unk> .
Why don ’ t ye be sensible , Flask ?
it ’ s easy to be sensible ; why don ’ t ye , then ?
any man with half an eye can be sensible . ” “ I don ’ t know that , Stubb .
You sometimes find it rather hard . ” “ Yes , when a fellow ’ s <unk> through , it ’ s hard to be sensible , that ’ s a fact .
And I am about <unk> with this spray .
Never mind ; catch the turn there , and pass it .
<unk> to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again .
<unk> these two anchors here , Flask , seems like <unk> a man ’ s hands behind him .
And what big generous hands they are , to be sure .
These are your iron <unk> , hey ?
What a hold they have , too !
I wonder , Flask , whether the world is <unk> anywhere ; if she is , she swings with an uncommon long cable , though .
There , hammer that knot down , and we ’ ve done .
So ; next to touching land , <unk> on deck is the most <unk> .
I say , just <unk> out my jacket <unk> , will ye ?
<unk> ye .
They laugh at <unk> so , Flask ; but seems to me , a long <unk> coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat .
The tails tapering down that way , serve to carry off the water , d ’ ye see .
<unk> with <unk> hats ; the <unk> form <unk> <unk> , Flask .
No more <unk> and <unk> for me ; I must mount a <unk> , and drive down a beaver ; so .
Halloa !
<unk> !
there goes my <unk> overboard ; Lord , Lord , that the winds that come from heaven should be so <unk> !
This is a <unk> night , lad . ” CHAPTER <unk> .
Midnight Aloft . — Thunder and <unk> .
_ The <unk> yard _ . — _ Tashtego passing new <unk> around it _ .
“ <unk> , um , um .
Stop that thunder !
<unk> too much thunder up here .
What ’ s the use of thunder ?
<unk> , um , um .
We don ’ t want thunder ; we want <unk> ; give us a glass of <unk> .
<unk> , um , um ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
During the most violent <unk> of the Typhoon , the man at the Pequod ’ s <unk> tiller had several times been <unk> hurled to the deck by its <unk> motions , even though <unk> tackles had been attached to it — for they were <unk> — because some play to the tiller was indispensable .
In a severe gale like this , while the ship is but a tossed <unk> to the blast , it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses , at intervals , go round and round .
It was thus with the Pequod ’ s ; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the <unk> ; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion .
Some hours after midnight , the Typhoon <unk> so much , that through the <unk> <unk> of Starbuck and Stubb — one engaged forward and the other aft — the shivered <unk> of the <unk> and fore and <unk> were cut adrift from the spars , and went eddying away to leeward , like the <unk> of an albatross , which sometimes are cast to the winds when that <unk> bird is on the wing .
The three corresponding new sails were now bent and <unk> , and a <unk> was set further aft ; so that the ship soon went through the water with some <unk> again ; and the course — for the present , <unk> — which he was to steer , if practicable , was once more given to the helmsman .
For during the violence of the gale , he had only steered according to its vicissitudes .
But as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible , watching the compass meanwhile , lo !
a good sign !
the wind seemed coming round astern ; aye , the foul breeze became fair !
Instantly the yards were <unk> , to the lively song of “ _ Ho !
the fair wind !
<unk> , <unk> men ! _ ” the crew singing for joy , that so promising an event should so soon have <unk> the evil portents preceding it .
In compliance with the standing order of his commander — to report immediately , and at any one of the <unk> hours , any decided change in the affairs of the deck , — Starbuck had no sooner <unk> the yards to the breeze — however <unk> and <unk> , — than he mechanically went below to <unk> Captain Ahab of the circumstance .
Ere knocking at his <unk> , he involuntarily paused before it a moment .
The cabin lamp — taking long swings this way and that — was burning <unk> , and casting <unk> shadows upon the old man ’ s bolted door , — a thin one , with fixed blinds inserted , in place of upper <unk> .
The isolated <unk> of the cabin made a certain humming silence to <unk> there , though it was <unk> round by all the roar of the elements .
The loaded muskets in the rack were <unk> revealed , as they stood upright against the forward <unk> .
Starbuck was an honest , upright man ; but out of Starbuck ’ s heart , at that instant when he saw the muskets , there strangely <unk> an evil thought ; but so <unk> with its <unk> or good <unk> that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself .
“ He would have shot me once , ” he murmured , “ yes , there ’ s the very musket that he pointed at me ; — that one with the <unk> stock ; let me touch it — lift it .
<unk> , that I , who have handled so many deadly lances , strange , that I should shake so now .
<unk> ?
I must see .
Aye , aye ; and powder in the <unk> ; — that ’ s not good .
<unk> <unk> it ? — wait .
I ’ ll <unk> myself of this .
I ’ ll hold the musket boldly while I think . — I come to report a fair wind to him .
But how fair ?
<unk> for death and doom , — _ that ’ s _ fair for Moby Dick .
It ’ s a fair wind that ’ s only fair for that accursed fish . — The very tube he pointed at me ! — the very one ; _ this _ one — I hold it here ; he would have killed me with the very thing I handle now . — Aye and he would fain kill all his crew .
Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale ?
Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant ?
and in these same perilous seas , <unk> he not his way by mere dead <unk> of the <unk> log ?
and in this very Typhoon , did he not swear that he would have no <unk> ?
But shall this <unk> old man be <unk> <unk> to drag a whole ship ’ s company down to doom with him ? — Yes , it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more , if this ship come to any deadly harm ; and come to deadly harm , my soul <unk> this ship will , if Ahab have his way .
If , then , he were this instant — put aside , that <unk> would not be his .
Ha !
is he muttering in his sleep ?
Yes , just there , — in there , he ’ s sleeping .
<unk> ?
aye , but still alive , and soon awake again .
I can ’ t withstand thee , then , old man .
Not <unk> ; not <unk> ; not <unk> wilt thou <unk> to ; all this thou <unk> .
<unk> obedience to thy own flat <unk> , this is all thou <unk> .
Aye , and say ’ st the men have vow ’ d thy vow ; say ’ st all of us are <unk> .
Great God <unk> ! — But is there no other way ?
no <unk> way ? — <unk> him a <unk> to be taken home ?
What !
hope to <unk> this old man ’ s living power from his own living hands ?
Only a fool would try it .
Say he were <unk> even ; knotted all over with ropes and <unk> ; <unk> down to <unk> on this cabin floor ; he would be more hideous than a <unk> tiger , then .
I could not endure the sight ; could not possibly fly his <unk> ; all comfort , sleep itself , <unk> reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage .
What , then , remains ?
The land is hundreds of leagues away , and locked Japan the nearest .
I stand alone here upon an open sea , with two oceans and a whole continent between me and law . — Aye , aye , ’ tis so . — Is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a <unk> murderer in his bed , <unk> sheets and skin together ? — And would I be a murderer , then , if ” — and slowly , <unk> , and half sideways looking , he placed the loaded musket ’ s end against the door .
“ On this level , Ahab ’ s hammock swings within ; his head this way .
A touch , and Starbuck may survive to <unk> his wife and child again . — Oh Mary !
Mary ! — boy !
boy !
boy ! — But if I wake thee not to death , old man , who can tell to what <unk> deeps Starbuck ’ s body this day week may sink , with all the crew !
Great God , where art Thou ?
Shall I ?
shall I ? — The wind has gone down and shifted , sir ; the fore and main <unk> are <unk> and set ; she heads her course . ” “ Stern all !
Oh Moby Dick , I clutch thy heart at last ! ” Such were the sounds that now came <unk> from out the old man ’ s tormented sleep , as if Starbuck ’ s voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak .
The yet levelled musket shook like a <unk> ’ s arm against the <unk> ; Starbuck seemed <unk> with an angel ; but turning from the door , he placed the <unk> in its rack , and left the place .
“ He ’ s too sound asleep , Mr. Stubb ; go thou down , and wake him , and tell him .
I must see to the deck here .
Thou know ’ st what to say . ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
Next morning the <unk> sea rolled in long slow billows of mighty bulk , and striving in the Pequod ’ s <unk> track , pushed her on like <unk> ’ palms <unk> .
The strong , <unk> breeze <unk> so , that sky and air seemed vast <unk> sails ; the whole world <unk> before the wind .
<unk> in the full morning light , the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place ; where his <unk> rays moved on in <unk> .
<unk> , as of <unk> <unk> kings and queens , reigned over everything .
The sea was as a <unk> of <unk> gold , that <unk> leaps with light and heat .
Long <unk> an enchanted silence , Ahab stood apart ; and every time the <unk> ship <unk> pitched down her bowsprit , he turned to eye the bright sun ’ s rays produced ahead ; and when she <unk> settled by the stern , he turned behind , and saw the sun ’ s <unk> place , and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake .
“ Ha , ha , my ship !
thou <unk> well be taken now for the <unk> of the sun .
Ho , ho !
all ye nations before my prow , I bring the sun to ye !
<unk> on the further billows ; <unk> !
a <unk> , I drive the sea ! ” But suddenly <unk> back by some <unk> thought , he hurried towards the helm , <unk> <unk> how the ship was heading .
“ <unk> , sir , ” said the frightened steersman .
“ Thou <unk> ! ” smiting him with his clenched <unk> .
“ <unk> East at this hour in the morning , and the sun astern ? ” Upon this every soul was confounded ; for the phenomenon just then observed by Ahab had <unk> escaped every one else ; but its very blinding <unk> must have been the cause .
<unk> his head half way into the binnacle , Ahab caught one glimpse of the compasses ; his uplifted arm slowly fell ; for a moment he almost seemed to <unk> .
Standing behind him Starbuck looked , and lo !
the two compasses pointed East , and the Pequod was as infallibly going West .
But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew , the old man with a <unk> laugh exclaimed , “ I have it !
It has happened before .
Mr. Starbuck , last night ’ s thunder turned our compasses — that ’ s all .
Thou hast before now heard of such a thing , I take it . ” “ Aye ; but never before has it happened to me , sir , ” said the pale mate , <unk> .
Here , it must needs be said , that accidents like this have in more than one case occurred to ships in violent storms .
The magnetic energy , as <unk> in the mariner ’ s needle , is , as all know , <unk> one with the <unk> beheld in heaven ; hence it is not to be much marvelled at , that such things should be .
<unk> where the lightning has actually struck the vessel , so as to <unk> down some of the spars and rigging , the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal ; all its <unk> virtue being <unk> , so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife ’ s <unk> needle .
But in either case , the needle never again , of itself , <unk> the original virtue thus <unk> or lost ; and if the binnacle compasses be affected , the same fate <unk> all the others that may be in the ship ; even were the <unk> one inserted into the <unk> .
<unk> standing before the binnacle , and eyeing the <unk> compasses , the old man , with the sharp of his extended hand , now took the precise bearing of the sun , and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted , shouted out his orders for the ship ’ s course to be changed accordingly .
The yards were hard up ; and once more the Pequod thrust her <unk> bows into the opposing wind , for the supposed fair one had only been <unk> her .
Meanwhile , whatever were his own secret thoughts , Starbuck said nothing , but quietly he issued all <unk> orders ; while Stubb and Flask — who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings — likewise <unk> <unk> .
As for the men , though some of them lowly <unk> , their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate .
But as ever before , the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly <unk> ; or if <unk> , it was only with a certain <unk> shot into their congenial hearts from <unk> Ahab ’ s .
For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries .
But chancing to <unk> with his ivory heel , he saw the crushed copper <unk> of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck .
“ Thou poor , proud <unk> and sun ’ s pilot !
yesterday I wrecked thee , and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me .
So , so .
But Ahab is lord over the level <unk> yet .
Mr. Starbuck — a lance without a pole ; a top-maul , and the smallest of the <unk> ’ s needles .
Quick ! ” <unk> , perhaps , to the <unk> <unk> the thing he was now about to do , were certain <unk> motives , whose object might have been to <unk> the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his <unk> skill , in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses .
Besides , the old man well knew that to steer by <unk> needles , though <unk> practicable , was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors , without some <unk> and evil portents .
“ Men , ” said he , steadily turning upon the crew , as the mate <unk> him the things he had demanded , “ my men , the thunder turned old Ahab ’ s needles ; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own , that will point as true as any . ” <unk> glances of <unk> wonder were <unk> by the sailors , as this was said ; and with <unk> eyes they <unk> whatever magic might follow .
But Starbuck looked away .
With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance , and then <unk> to the mate the long iron rod remaining , bade him hold it upright , without its touching the deck .
Then , with the <unk> , after <unk> smiting the upper end of this iron rod , he placed the <unk> needle <unk> on the top of it , and less strongly hammered that , several times , the mate still holding the rod as before .
Then going through some small strange motions with it — whether indispensable to the <unk> of the steel , or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew , is uncertain — he called for linen <unk> ; and moving to the binnacle , slipped out the two <unk> needles there , and horizontally suspended the <unk> by its middle , over one of the <unk> .
At first , the steel went round and round , <unk> and vibrating at either end ; but at last it settled to its place , when Ahab , who had been intently watching for this result , stepped <unk> back from the binnacle , and pointing his stretched arm towards it , exclaimed , — “ Look ye , for yourselves , if Ahab be not lord of the level <unk> !
The sun is East , and that compass <unk> it ! ” One after another they peered in , for nothing but their own eyes could <unk> such ignorance as theirs , and one after another they <unk> away .
In his fiery eyes of scorn and <unk> , you then saw Ahab in all his fatal pride .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> and Line .
While now the <unk> Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage , the log and line had but very seldom been in use .
<unk> to a <unk> <unk> upon other means of <unk> the vessel ’ s place , some <unk> , and many whalemen , especially when cruising , wholly <unk> to heave the log ; though at the same time , and frequently more for form ’ s sake than anything else , regularly putting down upon the customary <unk> the course steered by the ship , as well as the presumed <unk> rate of <unk> every hour .
It had been thus with the Pequod .
The wooden reel and <unk> log attached hung , long <unk> , just beneath the <unk> of the after bulwarks .
<unk> and spray had <unk> it ; sun and wind had <unk> it ; all the elements had combined to <unk> a thing that hung so <unk> .
But <unk> of all this , his mood seized Ahab , as he happened to glance upon the reel , not many hours after the <unk> scene , and he remembered how his quadrant was no more , and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line .
The ship was sailing <unk> ; astern the billows rolled in <unk> .
“ <unk> , there !
<unk> the log ! ” Two seamen came .
The <unk> <unk> and the <unk> Manxman .
“ Take the reel , one of ye , I ’ ll heave . ” They went towards the extreme stern , on the ship ’ s lee side , where the deck , with the <unk> energy of the wind , was now almost <unk> into the creamy , <unk> sea .
The Manxman took the reel , and holding it high up , by the projecting <unk> of the <unk> , round which the <unk> of line revolved , so stood with the <unk> log hanging downwards , till Ahab advanced to him .
Ahab stood before him , and was lightly <unk> some thirty or forty turns to form a preliminary <unk> to toss overboard , when the old Manxman , who was intently eyeing both him and the line , made bold to speak .
“ Sir , I <unk> it ; this line looks far gone , long heat and wet have spoiled it . ” “ ’ <unk> hold , old gentleman .
Long heat and wet , have they spoiled thee ?
Thou seem ’ st to hold .
Or , <unk> perhaps , life holds thee ; not thou it . ” “ I hold the <unk> , sir .
But just as my captain says .
With these grey hairs of mine ’ tis not worth while <unk> , ’ specially with a superior , who ’ ll <unk> ’ er confess . ” “ What ’ s that ?
There now ’ s a patched professor in Queen Nature ’ s <unk> <unk> ; but <unk> he ’ s too <unk> .
Where <unk> thou born ? ” “ In the little rocky Isle of Man , sir . ” “ <unk> !
Thou ’ st hit the world by that . ” “ I know not , sir , but I was born there . ” “ In the Isle of Man , hey ?
Well , the other way , it ’ s good .
Here ’ s a man from Man ; a man born in once independent Man , and now <unk> of Man ; which is sucked in — by what ?
Up with the reel !
The dead , blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last .
Up with it !
So . ” The log was heaved .
The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long dragging line astern , and then , instantly , the reel began to <unk> .
In turn , <unk> raised and lowered by the rolling billows , the towing <unk> of the log caused the old <unk> to <unk> strangely .
“ Hold hard ! ” <unk> !
the <unk> line <unk> down in one long <unk> ; the <unk> log was gone .
“ I crush the quadrant , the thunder turns the needles , and now the mad sea parts the <unk> .
But Ahab can mend all .
Haul in here , <unk> ; reel up , Manxman .
And look ye , let the carpenter make another log , and mend thou the line .
See to it . ” “ There he goes now ; to him nothing ’ s happened ; but to me , the <unk> seems <unk> out of the middle of the world .
Haul in , haul in , <unk> !
These lines run whole , and whirling out : come in broken , and dragging slow .
Ha , Pip ?
come to help ; eh , Pip ? ” “ Pip ?
whom call ye Pip ?
Pip jumped from the whale-boat .
Pip ’ s missing .
Let ’ s see now if ye haven ’ t <unk> him up here , fisherman .
It drags hard ; I guess he ’ s holding on .
<unk> him , Tahiti !
<unk> him off ; we haul in no cowards here .
Ho !
there ’ s his arm just breaking water .
A <unk> !
a <unk> !
cut it off — we haul in no cowards here .
Captain Ahab !
sir , sir !
here ’ s Pip , trying to get on board again . ” “ <unk> , thou crazy <unk> , ” cried the Manxman , seizing him by the arm .
“ Away from the quarter-deck ! ” “ The greater <unk> ever <unk> the <unk> , ” muttered Ahab , advancing .
“ Hands off from that <unk> !
Where <unk> thou Pip was , boy ?
“ <unk> there , sir , astern !
<unk> !
lo ! ” “ And who art thou , boy ?
I see not my reflection in the vacant <unk> of thy eyes .
Oh God !
that man should be a thing for immortal souls to <unk> through !
Who art thou , boy ? ” “ <unk> , sir ; ship ’ <unk> ; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
Pip !
Pip !
Pip !
One hundred <unk> of clay reward for Pip ; five feet high — looks <unk> — <unk> known by that !
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
Who ’ s seen Pip the coward ? ” “ There can be no hearts above the <unk> .
Oh , ye frozen heavens !
look down here .
Ye did beget this <unk> child , and have abandoned him , ye <unk> <unk> .
Here , boy ; Ahab ’ s cabin shall be Pip ’ s home <unk> , while Ahab lives .
Thou <unk> my <unk> centre , boy ; thou art tied to me by cords woven of my <unk> .
Come , let ’ s down . ” “ What ’ s this ?
here ’ s <unk> <unk> , ” intently gazing at Ahab ’ s hand , and feeling it .
“ Ah , now , had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this , perhaps he had <unk> ’ er been lost !
This seems to me , sir , as a <unk> ; something that <unk> souls may hold by .
Oh , sir , let old Perth now come and <unk> these two hands together ; the black one with the white , for I will not let this go . ” “ Oh , boy , nor will I thee , unless I should thereby drag thee to worse horrors than are here .
Come , then , to my cabin .
<unk> !
ye <unk> in gods all goodness , and in man all ill , lo you !
see the <unk> gods <unk> of suffering man ; and man , though <unk> , and knowing not what he does , yet full of the sweet things of love and <unk> .
Come !
I feel <unk> leading thee by thy black hand , than though I grasped an <unk> ’ s ! ” “ There go two <unk> ones now , ” muttered the old Manxman .
“ One <unk> with strength , the other <unk> with <unk> .
But here ’ s the end of the <unk> line — all dripping , too .
<unk> it , eh ?
I think we had best have a new line altogether .
I ’ ll see Mr. Stubb about it . ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
<unk> now <unk> by Ahab ’ s levelled steel , and her progress solely determined by Ahab ’ s level log and line ; the Pequod held on her path towards the Equator .
<unk> so long a passage through such <unk> waters , <unk> no ships , and ere long , sideways impelled by <unk> <unk> winds , over waves <unk> mild ; all these seemed the strange calm things <unk> some <unk> and desperate scene .
At last , when the ship drew near to the <unk> , as it were , of the <unk> <unk> , and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn , was sailing by a <unk> of rocky <unk> ; the watch — then headed by Flask — was startled by a cry so <unk> wild and unearthly — like <unk> <unk> of the ghosts of all <unk> ’ s murdered <unk> — that one and all , they started from their reveries , and for the space of some moments stood , or sat , or leaned all <unk> listening , like the carved Roman slave , while that wild cry remained within hearing .
The Christian or civilized part of the crew said it was <unk> , and <unk> ; but the pagan harpooneers remained <unk> .
Yet the grey Manxman — the oldest mariner of all — declared that the wild <unk> sounds that were heard , were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea .
<unk> in his hammock , Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn , when he came to the deck ; it was then <unk> to him by Flask , not <unk> with hinted dark meanings .
He <unk> laughed , and thus explained the wonder .
Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the <unk> of great numbers of seals , and some young seals that had lost their <unk> , or some <unk> that had lost their <unk> , must have <unk> nigh the ship and kept company with her , <unk> and <unk> with their human sort of <unk> .
But this only the more affected some of them , because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals , <unk> not only from their peculiar tones when in <unk> , but also from the human look of their round heads and <unk> faces , seen <unk> uprising from the water alongside .
In the sea , under certain circumstances , seals have more than once been mistaken for men .
But the <unk> of the crew were destined to receive a most <unk> <unk> in the fate of one of their number that morning .
At <unk> this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore ; and whether it was that he was not yet half <unk> from his sleep ( for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state ) , whether it was thus with the man , there is now no telling ; but , be that as it may , he had not been long at his perch , when a cry was heard — a cry and a rushing — and looking up , they saw a falling phantom in the air ; and looking down , a little tossed <unk> of white bubbles in the blue of the sea .
The life-buoy — a long slender cask — was dropped from the stern , where it always hung <unk> to a cunning spring ; but no hand rose to seize it , and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had <unk> , so that it slowly filled , and that <unk> wood also filled at its every <unk> ; and the <unk> <unk> cask followed the sailor to the bottom , as if to yield him his pillow , though in <unk> but a hard one .
And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the White Whale , on the White Whale ’ s own peculiar ground ; that man was swallowed up in the deep .
But few , perhaps , thought of that at the time .
Indeed , in some sort , they were not <unk> at this event , at least as a <unk> ; for they regarded it , not as a <unk> of evil in the future , but as the <unk> of an evil already <unk> .
They declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before .
But again the old Manxman said nay .
The lost life-buoy was now to be <unk> ; Starbuck was directed to see to it ; but as no cask of sufficient <unk> could be found , and as in the <unk> eagerness of what seemed the approaching <unk> of the voyage , all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end , whatever that might prove to be ; therefore , they were going to leave the ship ’ s stern <unk> with a <unk> , when by certain strange signs and <unk> Queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin .
“ A life-buoy of a coffin ! ” cried Starbuck , starting .
“ Rather queer , that , I should say , ” said Stubb .
“ It will make a good enough one , ” said Flask , “ the carpenter here can <unk> it easily . ” “ <unk> it up ; there ’ s nothing else for it , ” said Starbuck , after a melancholy pause .
“ <unk> it , carpenter ; do not look at me so — the coffin , I mean .
Dost thou hear me ?
<unk> it . ” “ And shall I nail down the lid , sir ? ” moving his hand as with a hammer .
“ Aye . ” “ And shall I <unk> the seams , sir ? ” moving his hand as with a <unk> .
“ Aye . ” “ And shall I then pay over the same with pitch , sir ? ” moving his hand as with a <unk> .
“ Away !
what <unk> thee to this ?
<unk> a life-buoy of the coffin , and no more . — Mr.
Stubb , Mr. Flask , come forward with me . ” “ He goes off in a <unk> .
The whole he can endure ; at the parts he <unk> .
Now I don ’ t like this .
I make a leg for Captain Ahab , and he wears it like a gentleman ; but I make a <unk> for Queequeg , and he won ’ t put his head into it .
Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin ?
And now I ’ m ordered to make a life-buoy of it .
It ’ s like turning an old coat ; going to bring the flesh on the other side now .
I don ’ t like this <unk> sort of business — I don ’ t like it at all ; it ’ s <unk> ; it ’ s not my place .
Let <unk> ’ <unk> do <unk> ; we are their <unk> .
I like to take in hand none but clean , virgin , <unk> <unk> <unk> , something that regularly begins at the beginning , and is at the middle when midway , and comes to an end at the conclusion ; not a <unk> ’ s job , that ’ s at an end in the middle , and at the beginning at the end .
It ’ s the old woman ’ s <unk> to be giving <unk> <unk> .
Lord !
what an <unk> all old women have for <unk> .
I know an old woman of <unk> who ran away with a <unk> young <unk> once .
And that ’ s the reason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore , when I kept my <unk> in the Vineyard ; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me .
But <unk> !
there are no <unk> at sea but <unk> .
Let me see .
<unk> down the lid ; <unk> the seams ; pay over the same with pitch ; <unk> them down tight , and hang it with the <unk> over the ship ’ s stern .
Were ever such things done before with a coffin ?
Some superstitious old carpenters , now , would be tied up in the rigging , ere they would do the job .
But I ’ m made of <unk> <unk> <unk> ; I don ’ t <unk> .
<unk> with a coffin !
<unk> about with a <unk> <unk> !
But never mind .
We <unk> in woods make <unk> and <unk> , as well as coffins and <unk> .
We work by the month , or by the job , or by the profit ; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work , unless it be too confounded <unk> , and then we <unk> it if we can .
<unk> !
I ’ ll do the job , now , <unk> .
I ’ ll have me — let ’ s see — how many in the ship ’ s company , all told ?
But I ’ ve forgotten .
Any way , I ’ ll have me thirty separate , Turk ’ <unk> <unk> , each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin .
Then , if the hull go down , there ’ ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin , a sight not seen very often beneath the sun !
Come hammer , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> !
Let ’ s to it . ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The Deck .
_ The coffin laid upon two <unk> , between the <unk> and the open hatchway ; the Carpenter <unk> its seams ; the string of twisted oakum slowly <unk> from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of his <unk> . — Ahab comes slowly from the <unk> , and hears Pip following him . _ “ Back , lad ; I will be with ye again presently .
He goes !
Not this hand <unk> with my humor more <unk> than that boy . — <unk> <unk> of a church !
What ’ s here ? ” “ <unk> , sir .
Mr. Starbuck ’ s orders .
Oh , look , sir !
Beware the hatchway ! ” “ <unk> ye , man .
Thy coffin lies <unk> to the <unk> . ” “ Sir ?
The hatchway ?
oh !
So it does , sir , so it does . ” “ <unk> not thou the <unk> ?
Look , did not this stump come from thy <unk> ? ” “ I believe it did , sir ; does the <unk> stand , sir ? ” “ Well enough .
But art thou not also the <unk> ? ” “ Aye , sir ; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg ; but they ’ ve set me now to turning it into something else . ” “ Then tell me ; art thou not an <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , heathenish old <unk> , to be one day making legs , and the next day coffins to <unk> them in , and yet again <unk> out of those same coffins ?
Thou art as <unk> as the gods , and as much of a <unk> . ” “ But I do not mean anything , sir .
I do as I do . ” “ The gods again .
Hark ye , dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin ?
The <unk> , they say , <unk> <unk> when <unk> out the <unk> for <unk> ; and the <unk> in the play <unk> , spade in hand .
Dost thou never ? ” “ Sing , sir ?
Do I sing ?
Oh , I ’ m indifferent enough , sir , for that ; but the reason why the <unk> made <unk> must have been because there was none in his spade , sir .
But the <unk> <unk> is full of it .
Hark to it . ” “ Aye , and that ’ s because the lid there ’ s a <unk> ; and what in all things makes the <unk> is this — there ’ s naught beneath .
And yet , a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same , Carpenter .
Hast thou ever helped carry a <unk> , and heard the coffin <unk> against the <unk> gate , going in ?
“ Faith , sir , I ’ ve — — ” “ Faith ?
What ’ s that ? ” “ Why , faith , sir , it ’ s only a sort of <unk> — that ’ s all , sir . ” “ <unk> , um ; go on . ” “ I was about to say , sir , that — — ” “ <unk> thou a <unk> ?
Dost thou <unk> thy own shroud out of thyself ?
Look at thy bosom !
<unk> !
and get these <unk> out of sight . ” “ He goes aft .
That was sudden , now ; but squalls come sudden in hot latitudes .
I ’ ve heard that the Isle of <unk> , one of the <unk> , is cut by the Equator right in the middle .
<unk> to me some sort of Equator <unk> yon old man , too , right in his middle .
He ’ s always under the Line — fiery hot , I tell ye !
He ’ s looking this way — come , oakum ; quick .
Here we go again .
This wooden <unk> is the <unk> , and I ’ m the professor of <unk> glasses — <unk> , <unk> ! ” ( _ Ahab to himself _ . )
“ There ’ s a sight !
There ’ s a sound !
The <unk> <unk> <unk> the hollow tree !
<unk> and dumb might well be <unk> now .
See !
that thing <unk> on two <unk> , full of <unk> .
A most malicious <unk> , that fellow .
<unk> !
So man ’ s <unk> <unk> !
Oh !
how <unk> are all <unk> !
What things real are there , but <unk> thoughts ?
Here now ’ s the very dreaded symbol of grim death , by a mere <unk> , made the <unk> sign of the help and hope of most <unk> life .
A life-buoy of a coffin !
Does it go further ?
Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is , after all , but an <unk> !
I ’ ll think of that .
But no .
So far gone am I in the dark side of earth , that its other side , the <unk> bright one , seems but uncertain twilight to me .
Will ye never have done , Carpenter , with that accursed sound ?
I go below ; let me not see that thing here when I return again .
Now , then , Pip , we ’ ll talk this over ; I do <unk> most wondrous <unk> from thee !
Some unknown <unk> from the unknown worlds must empty into thee ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The Pequod Meets The Rachel .
Next day , a large ship , the Rachel , was descried , bearing directly down upon the Pequod , all her spars thickly <unk> with men .
At the time the Pequod was making good speed through the water ; but as the <unk> windward stranger shot nigh to her , the <unk> sails all fell together as blank <unk> that are burst , and all life fled from the smitten hull .
“ <unk> news ; she <unk> bad news , ” muttered the old Manxman .
But ere her commander , who , with trumpet to mouth , stood up in his boat ; ere he could <unk> hail , Ahab ’ s voice was heard .
“ Hast seen the White Whale ? ” “ Aye , yesterday .
Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift ? ” <unk> his joy , Ahab <unk> answered this <unk> question ; and would then have fain boarded the stranger , when the stranger captain himself , having stopped his vessel ’ s way , was seen descending her side .
A few keen <unk> , and his <unk> soon <unk> the Pequod ’ s <unk> , and he sprang to the deck .
<unk> he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew .
But no <unk> <unk> was <unk> .
“ Where was he ? — not killed ! — not killed ! ” cried Ahab , closely advancing .
“ How was it ? ” It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous , while three of the stranger ’ s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales , which had led them some four or five miles from the ship ; and while they were yet in swift chase to windward , the white hump and head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water , not very far to leeward ; <unk> , the fourth rigged boat — a reserved one — had been instantly lowered in chase .
After a keen sail before the wind , this fourth boat — the <unk> <unk> of all — seemed to have succeeded in <unk> — at least , as well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything about it .
In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat ; and then a swift <unk> of <unk> white water ; and after that nothing more ; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have <unk> run away with his pursuers , as often happens .
There was some apprehension , but no <unk> alarm , as yet .
The recall <unk> were placed in the rigging ; darkness came on ; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats — ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction — the ship had not only been <unk> to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight , but , for the time , to <unk> her distance from it .
But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard , she <unk> all sail — <unk> on <unk> — after the missing boat ; <unk> a fire in her <unk> for a <unk> ; and every other man aloft on the look-out .
But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen ; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her ; and not finding anything , had again dashed on ; again paused , and lowered her boats ; and though she had thus continued doing till daylight ; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen .
The story told , the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his object in <unk> the Pequod .
He desired that ship to unite with his own in the search ; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart , on parallel lines , and so sweeping a double horizon , as it were .
“ I will <unk> something now , ” whispered Stubb to Flask , “ that some one in that missing boat wore off that Captain ’ s best coat ; <unk> , his watch — he ’ s so cursed anxious to get it back .
Who ever heard of two pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height of the whaling season ?
See , Flask , only see how pale he looks — pale in the very <unk> of his eyes — look — it wasn ’ t the coat — it must have been the — ” “ My boy , my own boy is among them .
For God ’ s sake — I <unk> , I <unk> ” — here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab , who thus far had but <unk> received his <unk> .
“ For <unk> hours let me <unk> your ship — I will gladly pay for it , and <unk> pay for it — if there be no other way — for <unk> hours only — only that — you must , oh , you must , and you _ shall _ do this thing . ” “ His son ! ” cried Stubb , “ oh , it ’ s his son he ’ s lost !
I take back the coat and watch — what says Ahab ?
We must save that boy . ” “ He ’ s drowned with the rest on ’ em , last night , ” said the old <unk> sailor standing behind them ; “ I heard ; all of ye heard their spirits . ” Now , as it shortly turned out , what made this incident of the Rachel ’ s the more melancholy , was the circumstance , that not only was one of the Captain ’ s sons among the number of the missing boat ’ s crew ; but among the number of the other boat ’ s crews , at the same time , but on the other hand , separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase , there had been still another son ; as that for a time , the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the <unk> <unk> ; which was only <unk> for him by his chief mate ’ s instinctively <unk> the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such <unk> , that is , when placed between <unk> but divided boats , always to pick up the <unk> first .
But the captain , for some unknown <unk> reason , had refrained from <unk> all this , and not till forced to it by Ahab ’ s <unk> did he <unk> to his one yet missing boy ; a little lad , but twelve years old , whose father with the earnest but <unk> <unk> of a Nantucketer ’ s <unk> love , had thus early sought to <unk> him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost <unk> the <unk> of all his race .
Nor does it <unk> occur , that Nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them , for a <unk> three or four years ’ voyage in some other ship than their own ; so that their first knowledge of a whaleman ’ s career shall be <unk> by any chance <unk> of a father ’ s natural but <unk> <unk> , or <unk> apprehensiveness and concern .
Meantime , now the stranger was still <unk> his poor <unk> of Ahab ; and Ahab still stood like an anvil , receiving every shock , but without the least <unk> of his own .
“ I will not go , ” said the stranger , “ till you say _ aye _ to me .
Do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case .
For _ you _ too have a boy , Captain Ahab — though but a child , and <unk> safely at home now — a child of your old age too — Yes , yes , you <unk> ; I see it — run , run , men , now , and stand by to square in the yards . ” “ Avast , ” cried Ahab — “ touch not a <unk> ” ; then in a voice that <unk> <unk> every word — “ Captain <unk> , I will not do it .
Even now I lose time .
Good-bye , good-bye .
God bless ye , man , and may I <unk> myself , but I must go .
Mr. Starbuck , look at the binnacle watch , and in three minutes from this present instant <unk> off all strangers : then brace forward again , and let the ship sail as before . ” <unk> turning , with <unk> face , he descended into his cabin , leaving the strange captain <unk> at this unconditional and utter <unk> of his so earnest suit .
But starting from his <unk> , <unk> silently hurried to the side ; more fell than stepped into his boat , and returned to his ship .
Soon the two ships <unk> their wakes ; and long as the strange vessel was in view , she was seen to <unk> hither and thither at every dark spot , however small , on the sea .
This way and that her yards were swung round ; starboard and larboard , she continued to <unk> ; now she beat against a head sea ; and again it pushed her before it ; while all the while , her masts and yards were thickly <unk> with men , as three tall <unk> trees , when the boys are <unk> among the <unk> .
But by her still <unk> course and winding , <unk> way , you plainly saw that this ship that so <unk> with spray , still remained without comfort .
She was Rachel , <unk> for her children , because they were not .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Cabin .
( _ Ahab moving to go on deck ; Pip <unk> him by the hand to follow . _ ) “ <unk> , lad , I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now .
The hour is coming when Ahab would not <unk> thee from him , yet would not have thee by him .
There is that in thee , poor lad , which I feel too <unk> to my <unk> .
Like <unk> like ; and for this hunt , my <unk> becomes my most desired health .
Do thou <unk> below here , where they shall serve thee , as if thou <unk> the captain .
Aye , lad , thou <unk> sit here in my own screwed chair ; another <unk> to it , thou must be . ” “ No , no , no !
ye have not a whole body , sir ; do ye but use poor me for your one lost leg ; only <unk> upon me , sir ; I ask no more , so I remain a part of ye . ” “ Oh !
spite of <unk> <unk> , this makes me a <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of man ! — and a black !
and crazy ! — but <unk> <unk> <unk> to him too ; he <unk> so <unk> again . ” “ They tell me , sir , that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip , whose drowned bones now show white , for all the blackness of his living skin .
But I will never desert ye , sir , as Stubb did him .
Sir , I must go with ye . ” “ If thou <unk> thus to me much more , Ahab ’ s purpose keels up in him .
I tell thee no ; it cannot be . ” “ Oh good master , master , master !
“ <unk> so , and I will murder thee !
have a care , for Ahab too is mad .
<unk> , and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck , and still know that I am there .
And now I quit thee .
Thy hand ! — <unk> !
True art thou , lad , as the circumference to its centre .
So : God for ever bless thee ; and if it come to that , — God for ever save thee , let what will <unk> . ” ( _ Ahab goes ; Pip steps one step forward . _ ) “ Here he this instant stood ; I stand in his air , — but I ’ m alone .
Now were even poor Pip here I could endure it , but he ’ s missing .
Pip !
Pip !
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
Who ’ s seen Pip ?
He must be up here ; let ’ s try the door .
What ?
neither lock , nor bolt , nor bar ; and yet there ’ s no opening it .
It must be the spell ; he told me to stay here : Aye , and told me this screwed chair was mine .
Here , then , I ’ ll seat me , against the transom , in the ship ’ s full middle , all her keel and her three masts before me .
Here , our old sailors say , in their black <unk> great <unk> sometimes sit at table , and lord it over rows of captains and <unk> .
Ha !
what ’ s this ?
<unk> !
<unk> !
the <unk> all come crowding !
<unk> round the <unk> ; glad to see ye ; fill up , <unk> !
What an odd feeling , now , when a black boy ’ s host to white men with gold <unk> upon their <unk> ! — <unk> , have ye seen one Pip ? — a little negro lad , five feet high , <unk> look , and <unk> !
<unk> from a whale-boat once ; — seen him ?
No !
Well then , fill up again , captains , and let ’ s drink <unk> upon all cowards !
I name no names .
<unk> upon them !
<unk> one foot upon the table .
<unk> upon all cowards . — Hist !
above there , I hear ivory — Oh , master !
master !
I am indeed <unk> when you walk over me .
But here I ’ ll stay , though this stern strikes rocks ; and they <unk> through ; and <unk> come to join me . ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
And now that at the proper time and place , after so long and wide a preliminary cruise , Ahab , — all other whaling waters swept — seemed to have chased his foe into an <unk> , to slay him the more <unk> there ; now , that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his <unk> wound had been <unk> ; now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered Moby Dick ; — and now that all his successive <unk> with various ships <unk> <unk> to show the <unk> indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters , whether <unk> or <unk> against ; now it was that there lurked a something in the old man ’ s eyes , which it was hardly sufferable for <unk> souls to see .
As the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which through the <unk> , <unk> , six months ’ night <unk> its piercing , steady , central gaze ; so Ahab ’ s purpose now <unk> gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew .
It <unk> above them so , that all their <unk> , doubts , <unk> , fears , were fain to hide beneath their souls , and not <unk> forth a single spear or <unk> .
In this <unk> interval too , all humor , forced or natural , <unk> .
Stubb no more strove to raise a smile ; Starbuck no more strove to check one .
<unk> , joy and sorrow , hope and fear , seemed ground to finest dust , and <unk> , for the time , in the <unk> <unk> of Ahab ’ s iron soul .
Like <unk> , they <unk> moved about the deck , ever conscious that the old man ’ s <unk> eye was on them .
But did you deeply <unk> him in his more secret confidential hours ; when he thought no glance but one was on him ; then you would have seen that even as Ahab ’ s eyes so <unk> the crew ’ s , the inscrutable Parsee ’ s glance <unk> his ; or somehow , at least , in some wild way , at times affected it .
Such an added , gliding <unk> began to invest the thin Fedallah now ; such <unk> <unk> shook him ; that the men looked <unk> at him ; half uncertain , as it seemed , whether indeed he were a mortal substance , or else a <unk> shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being ’ s body .
And that shadow was always hovering there .
For not by night , even , had Fedallah ever certainly been known to <unk> , or go below .
He would stand still for hours : but never sat or leaned ; his <unk> but wondrous eyes did plainly say — We two <unk> never rest .
Nor , at any time , by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck , unless Ahab was before them ; either standing in his pivot-hole , or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating <unk> , — the main-mast and the <unk> ; or else they saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle , — his living foot advanced upon the deck , as if to step ; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes ; so that however motionless he stood , however the days and nights were added on , that he had not swung in his hammock ; yet hidden beneath that <unk> hat , they could never tell <unk> whether , for all this , his eyes were really closed at times ; or whether he was still intently <unk> them ; no matter , though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch , and the <unk> <unk> gathered in <unk> of <unk> upon that <unk> coat and hat .
The clothes that the night had wet , the next day ’ s <unk> dried upon him ; and so , day after day , and night after night ; he went no more beneath the planks ; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for .
He <unk> in the same open air ; that is , his two only meals , — breakfast and dinner : supper he never touched ; nor <unk> his beard ; which <unk> grew all <unk> , as <unk> <unk> of trees blown over , which still grow <unk> on at naked base , though perished in the upper verdure .
But though his whole life was now become one watch on deck ; and though the Parsee ’ s mystic watch was without <unk> as his own ; yet these two never seemed to speak — one man to the other — unless at long intervals some passing <unk> matter made it necessary .
Though such a potent spell seemed <unk> to join the twain ; <unk> , and to the <unk> crew , they seemed <unk> <unk> .
If by day they chanced to speak one word ; by night , dumb men were both , so far as concerned the slightest <unk> <unk> .
At times , for <unk> hours , without a single hail , they stood far parted in the <unk> ; Ahab in his scuttle , the Parsee by the mainmast ; but still <unk> gazing upon each other ; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his <unk> shadow , in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned substance .
And yet , somehow , did Ahab — in his own proper self , as daily , <unk> , and every instant , <unk> revealed to his <unk> , — Ahab seemed an independent lord ; the Parsee but his slave .
Still again both seemed <unk> together , and an unseen <unk> driving them ; the lean shade <unk> the solid rib .
For be this Parsee what he may , all rib and keel was solid Ahab .
At the first <unk> <unk> of the dawn , his iron voice was heard from aft , — “ Man the mast-heads ! ” — and all through the day , till after sunset and after twilight , the same voice every hour , at the striking of the helmsman ’ s bell , was heard — “ What d ’ ye see ? — sharp !
sharp ! ” But when three or four days had <unk> by , after meeting the <unk> Rachel ; and no spout had yet been seen ; the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew ’ s <unk> ; at least , of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers ; he seemed to doubt , even , whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly <unk> the sight he sought .
But if these suspicions were really his , he <unk> refrained from <unk> <unk> them , however his <unk> might seem to hint them .
“ I will have the first sight of the whale myself , ” — he said .
“ Aye !
Ahab must have the doubloon ! ” and with his own hands he rigged a nest of <unk> <unk> ; and sending a hand aloft , with a single <unk> block , to secure to the main-mast head , he received the two ends of the <unk> rope ; and <unk> one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end , in order to fasten it at the rail .
This done , with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin , he looked round upon his crew , sweeping from one to the other ; pausing his glance long upon Daggoo , Queequeg , Tashtego ; but <unk> Fedallah ; and then <unk> his firm <unk> eye upon the chief mate , said , — “ Take the rope , sir — I give it into thy hands , Starbuck . ” Then <unk> his person in the basket , he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch , Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last ; and afterwards stood near it .
And thus , with one hand clinging round the royal mast , Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles , — ahead , astern , this side , and that , — within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height .
When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging , which chances to afford no <unk> , the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot , and <unk> there by the rope ; under these circumstances , its fastened end on deck is always given in <unk> charge to some one man who has the special watch of it .
Because in such a <unk> of running rigging , whose various different <unk> aloft cannot always be infallibly <unk> by what is seen of them at the deck ; and when the <unk> of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the <unk> , it would be but a natural fatality , if , <unk> with a constant <unk> , the hoisted sailor should by some <unk> of the crew be cast adrift and fall all <unk> to the sea .
So Ahab ’ s proceedings in this matter were not unusual ; the only strange thing about them seemed to be , that Starbuck , almost the one only man who had ever <unk> to <unk> him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to <unk> — one of those too , whose <unk> on the look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat ; — it was strange , that this was the very man he should <unk> for his <unk> ; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person ’ s hands .
Now , the first time Ahab was perched aloft ; ere he had been there ten minutes ; one of those <unk> savage <unk> which so often fly <unk> close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these latitudes ; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a <unk> of <unk> swift <unk> .
Then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air ; then <unk> downwards , and went eddying again round his head .
But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon , Ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird ; nor , indeed , would any one else have marked it much , it being no uncommon circumstance ; only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight .
“ Your hat , your hat , sir ! ” suddenly cried the <unk> seaman , who being posted at the <unk> , stood directly behind Ahab , though somewhat lower than his level , and with a deep gulf of air dividing them .
But already the sable wing was before the old man ’ s eyes ; the long hooked bill at his head : with a <unk> , the black <unk> darted away with his <unk> .
An eagle flew thrice round <unk> ’ s head , removing his cap to <unk> it , and <unk> <unk> , his wife , declared that <unk> would be king of Rome .
But only by the <unk> of the cap was that omen accounted good .
Ahab ’ s hat was never <unk> ; the wild <unk> flew on and on with it ; far in advance of the prow : and at last disappeared ; while from the point of that <unk> , a minute black spot was dimly <unk> , falling from that vast height into the sea .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Pequod Meets The Delight .
The intense Pequod sailed on ; the rolling waves and days went by ; the <unk> still lightly swung ; and another ship , most <unk> <unk> the Delight , was descried .
As she drew nigh , all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams , called <unk> , which , in some <unk> , cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet ; <unk> to carry the spare , <unk> , or <unk> boats .
Upon the stranger ’ s <unk> were beheld the shattered , white ribs , and some few splintered planks , of what had once been a whale-boat ; but you now saw through this wreck , as plainly as you see through the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> skeleton of a horse .
“ Hast seen the White Whale ? ” “ Look ! ” replied the <unk> captain from his taffrail ; and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck .
“ Hast killed him ? ” “ The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that , ” answered the other , sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck , whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in <unk> together .
“ Not forged ! ” and snatching Perth ’ s levelled iron from the crotch , Ahab held it out , <unk> — “ Look ye , Nantucketer ; here in this hand I hold his death !
<unk> in blood , and <unk> by lightning are these barbs ; and I swear to <unk> them <unk> in that hot place behind the fin , where the White Whale most feels his accursed life ! ” “ Then God keep thee , old man — see ’ st thou that ” — pointing to the hammock — “ I bury but one of five stout men , who were alive only yesterday ; but were dead ere night .
Only _ that _ one I bury ; the rest were buried before they died ; you sail upon their tomb . ” Then turning to his crew — “ Are ye ready there ?
place the plank then on the rail , and lift the body ; so , then — Oh !
God ” — advancing towards the hammock with uplifted hands — “ may the resurrection and the life — — ” “ <unk> forward !
Up helm ! ” cried Ahab like lightning to his men .
But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the <unk> that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea ; not so quick , indeed , but that some of the flying bubbles might have <unk> her hull with their <unk> <unk> .
As Ahab now glided from the <unk> Delight , the strange life-buoy hanging at the Pequod ’ s stern came into conspicuous relief .
“ Ha !
yonder !
look yonder , men ! ” cried a <unk> voice in her wake .
“ In vain , oh , ye strangers , ye fly our sad <unk> ; ye but turn us your taffrail to show us your coffin ! ” CHAPTER <unk> .
The <unk> .
It was a clear <unk> day .
The <unk> of air and sea were hardly <unk> in that <unk> azure ; only , the <unk> air was <unk> pure and soft , with a woman ’ s look , and the <unk> and <unk> sea heaved with long , strong , lingering swells , as <unk> ’ s chest in his sleep .
<unk> , and thither , on high , glided the snow-white wings of small , <unk> birds ; these were the gentle thoughts of the <unk> air ; but to and fro in the deeps , far down in the bottomless blue , rushed mighty leviathans , sword-fish , and sharks ; and these were the strong , troubled , murderous <unk> of the <unk> sea .
But though thus contrasting within , the contrast was only in shades and shadows without ; those two seemed one ; it was only the <unk> , as it were , that distinguished them .
Aloft , like a royal <unk> and king , the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea ; even as bride to <unk> .
And at the <unk> line of the horizon , a soft and <unk> motion — most seen here at the equator — <unk> the fond , <unk> trust , the loving <unk> , with which the poor bride gave her bosom away .
<unk> up and twisted ; <unk> and knotted with wrinkles ; <unk> firm and <unk> ; his eyes glowing like coals , that still <unk> in the ashes of ruin ; <unk> Ahab stood forth in the <unk> of the <unk> ; lifting his splintered <unk> of a brow to the fair girl ’ s forehead of heaven .
Oh , immortal infancy , and <unk> of the azure !
<unk> <unk> creatures that <unk> all round us !
<unk> <unk> of air and sky !
how <unk> were ye of old Ahab ’ s <unk> woe !
But so have I seen little <unk> and Martha , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> around their old <unk> ; sporting with the circle of <unk> <unk> which grew on the <unk> of that <unk> <unk> of his brain .
<unk> crossing the deck from the scuttle , Ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze , the more and the more that he strove to <unk> the <unk> .
But the lovely <unk> in that enchanted air did at last seem to <unk> , for a moment , the <unk> thing in his soul .
That glad , happy air , that <unk> sky , did at last stroke and <unk> him ; the <unk> world , so long cruel — <unk> — now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck , and did seem to <unk> <unk> over him , as if over one , that however wilful and <unk> , she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless .
From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea ; nor did all the Pacific contain such <unk> as that one <unk> drop .
Starbuck saw the old man ; saw him , how he heavily leaned over the side ; and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless <unk> that stole out of the centre of the serenity around .
<unk> not to touch him , or be noticed by him , he yet drew near to him , and stood there .
Ahab turned .
“ Starbuck ! ” “ Sir . ” “ Oh , Starbuck !
it is a mild , mild wind , and a mild looking sky .
On such a day — very much such a <unk> as this — I struck my first whale — a <unk> of eighteen !
<unk> — forty — forty years ago ! — ago !
<unk> years of continual whaling !
forty years of <unk> , and peril , and <unk> !
forty years on the <unk> sea !
for forty years has Ahab <unk> the peaceful land , for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep !
Aye and yes , Starbuck , out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore .
When I think of this life I have led ; the <unk> of <unk> it has been ; the <unk> , <unk> of a Captain ’ s <unk> , which <unk> but small entrance to any <unk> from the green country without — oh , <unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> <unk> of solitary command ! — when I think of all this ; only <unk> , not so <unk> known to me before — and how for forty years I have <unk> upon dry salted fare — fit <unk> of the dry <unk> of my soil ! — when the <unk> landsman has had fresh <unk> to his daily hand , and broken the world ’ s fresh bread to my mouldy <unk> — away , whole oceans away , from that young <unk> I wedded past fifty , and sailed for Cape Horn the next day , leaving but one <unk> in my <unk> pillow — wife ?
wife ? — rather a widow with her <unk> alive !
Aye , I <unk> that poor girl when I <unk> her , Starbuck ; and then , the madness , the <unk> , the boiling blood and the smoking brow , with which , for a thousand <unk> old Ahab has furiously , <unk> chased his prey — more a <unk> than a man ! — aye , aye !
what a forty years ’ fool — fool — old fool , has old Ahab been !
Why this <unk> of the chase ?
why weary , and <unk> the arm at the oar , and the iron , and the lance ?
how the <unk> or better is Ahab now ?
<unk> .
Oh , Starbuck !
is it not hard , that with this weary <unk> I bear , one poor leg should have been snatched from under me ?
Here , <unk> this old hair aside ; it blinds me , that I seem to <unk> .
<unk> so grey did never grow but from out some ashes !
But do I look very old , so very , very old , Starbuck ?
I feel deadly faint , bowed , and <unk> , as though I were Adam , <unk> beneath the piled centuries since Paradise .
God !
God !
God ! — crack my heart ! — stave my brain ! — <unk> !
<unk> !
bitter , biting <unk> of grey hairs , have I lived enough joy to wear ye ; and seem and feel thus <unk> old ?
<unk> !
stand close to me , Starbuck ; let me look into a human eye ; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky ; better than to gaze upon God .
By the green land ; by the bright <unk> !
this is the magic glass , man ; I see my wife and my child in thine eye .
No , no ; stay on board , on board ! — lower not when I do ; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick .
That <unk> shall not be thine .
No , no !
not with the far away home I see in that eye ! ” “ Oh , my Captain !
my Captain !
noble soul !
grand old heart , after all !
why should any one give chase to that hated fish !
Away with me !
let us fly these deadly waters !
let us home !
<unk> and child , too , are Starbuck ’ s — wife and child of his <unk> , <unk> , <unk> youth ; even as thine , sir , are the wife and child of thy loving , <unk> , <unk> old age !
Away !
let us away ! — this instant let me <unk> the course !
How cheerily , how <unk> , O my Captain , would we bowl on our way to see old Nantucket again !
I think , sir , they have some such mild blue days , even as this , in Nantucket . ” “ They have , they have .
I have seen them — some summer days in the morning .
About this time — yes , it is his noon nap now — the boy <unk> wakes ; sits up in bed ; and his mother tells him of me , of cannibal old me ; how I am abroad upon the deep , but will yet come back to dance him again . ” “ ’ Tis my Mary , my Mary herself !
She <unk> that my boy , every morning , should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father ’ s sail !
Yes , yes !
no more !
it is done !
we head for Nantucket !
Come , my Captain , study out the course , and let us away !
See , see !
the boy ’ s face from the window !
the boy ’ s hand on the hill ! ” But Ahab ’ s glance was <unk> ; like a <unk> <unk> tree he shook , and cast his last , <unk> <unk> to the soil .
“ What is it , what nameless , inscrutable , unearthly thing is it ; what <unk> , hidden lord and master , and cruel , remorseless <unk> <unk> me ; that against all natural <unk> and <unk> , I so keep pushing , and crowding , and <unk> myself on all the time ; recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper , natural heart , I <unk> not so much as dare ?
Is Ahab , Ahab ?
Is it I , God , or who , that <unk> this arm ?
But if the great sun move not of himself ; but is as an <unk> in heaven ; nor one single <unk> can <unk> , but by some invisible power ; how then can this one small heart beat ; this one small brain think thoughts ; unless God does that beating , does that thinking , does that living , and not I.
By heaven , man , we are turned round and round in this world , like yonder windlass , and Fate is the <unk> .
And all the time , lo !
that <unk> sky , and this <unk> sea !
Look !
see yon <unk> !
who put it into him to chase and <unk> that <unk> ?
Where do murderers go , man !
Who ’ s to doom , when the judge himself is dragged to the bar ?
But it is a mild , mild wind , and a mild looking sky ; and the air smells now , as if it blew from a <unk> meadow ; they have been making <unk> somewhere under the <unk> of the Andes , Starbuck , and the mowers are sleeping among the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ?
Aye , toil we how we may , we all sleep at last on the field .
<unk> ?
Aye , and rust amid <unk> ; as last year ’ s <unk> flung down , and left in the <unk> <unk> — Starbuck ! ” But <unk> to a corpse ’ s hue with despair , the <unk> had <unk> away .
Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side ; but started at two <unk> , fixed eyes in the water there .
Fedallah was <unk> leaning over the same rail .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Chase — First Day .
That night , in the <unk> , when the old man — as his wont at intervals — stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned , and went to his pivot-hole , he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely , <unk> up the sea air as a sagacious ship ’ s dog will , in drawing nigh to some <unk> isle .
He declared that a whale must be near .
Soon that peculiar odor , sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale , was <unk> to all the watch ; nor was any mariner surprised when , after <unk> the compass , and then the <unk> , and then <unk> the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible , Ahab rapidly ordered the ship ’ s course to be slightly <unk> , and the sail to be <unk> .
The <unk> policy <unk> these <unk> was sufficiently <unk> at <unk> , by the sight of a long <unk> on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead , smooth as oil , and resembling in the <unk> watery wrinkles <unk> it , the polished <unk> marks of some swift <unk> , at the mouth of a deep , rapid stream .
“ Man the mast-heads !
<unk> all hands ! ” <unk> with the butts of three <unk> handspikes on the forecastle deck , Daggoo <unk> the sleepers with such judgment <unk> that they seemed to <unk> from the scuttle , so <unk> did they appear with their clothes in their hands .
“ What d ’ ye see ? ” cried Ahab , <unk> his face to the sky .
“ Nothing , nothing sir ! ” was the sound hailing down in reply .
“ <unk> ’ gallant sails ! — <unk> !
<unk> and aloft , and on both sides ! ” All sail being set , he now cast loose the <unk> , reserved for swaying him to the main <unk> head ; and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither , when , while but two thirds of the way aloft , and while peering ahead through the horizontal <unk> between the <unk> and <unk> , he raised a <unk> cry in the air .
“ There she blows ! — there she blows !
A hump like a <unk> !
It is Moby Dick ! ” <unk> by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three look-outs , the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing .
Ahab had now gained his final perch , some feet above the other look-outs , Tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the <unk> , so that the Indian ’ s head was almost on a level with Ahab ’ s heel .
From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead , at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump , and regularly <unk> his silent spout into the air .
To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the <unk> Atlantic and Indian <unk> .
“ And did none of ye see it before ? ” cried Ahab , hailing the perched men all around him .
“ I saw him almost that same instant , sir , that Captain Ahab did , and I cried out , ” said Tashtego .
“ Not the same instant ; not the same — no , the doubloon is mine , Fate reserved the doubloon for me .
_ I _ only ; none of ye could have raised the White Whale first .
There she blows ! — there she blows ! — there she blows !
There again ! — there again ! ” he cried , in <unk> , lingering , <unk> tones , <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of the whale ’ s visible jets .
“ He ’ s going to sound !
In <unk> !
Down <unk> !
Stand by three boats .
Mr. Starbuck , remember , stay on board , and keep the ship .
<unk> there !
<unk> , <unk> a point !
So ; steady , man , steady !
There go flukes !
No , no ; only black water !
All ready the boats there ?
Stand by , stand by !
Lower me , Mr. Starbuck ; lower , lower , — quick , <unk> ! ” and he slid through the air to the deck .
“ He is heading straight to leeward , sir , ” cried Stubb , “ right away from us ; cannot have seen the ship yet . ” “ Be dumb , man !
Stand by the braces !
<unk> down the helm ! — brace up !
<unk> her ! — shiver her ! — So ; well that !
<unk> , boats ! ” Soon all the boats but Starbuck ’ s were dropped ; all the <unk> set — all the <unk> <unk> ; with <unk> swiftness , shooting to leeward ; and Ahab heading the onset .
A pale , <unk> <unk> up Fedallah ’ s sunken eyes ; a hideous motion <unk> his mouth .
Like noiseless <unk> <unk> , their light <unk> <unk> through the sea ; but only slowly they neared the foe .
As they neared him , the ocean grew still more smooth ; seemed drawing a <unk> over its waves ; seemed a <unk> , so <unk> it spread .
At length the <unk> hunter came so nigh his seemingly <unk> prey , that his entire <unk> hump was distinctly visible , sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing , and continually set in a revolving ring of finest , <unk> , <unk> foam .
He saw the vast , involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond .
<unk> it , far out on the soft <unk> waters , went the glistening white shadow from his broad , milky forehead , a <unk> <unk> <unk> accompanying the shade ; and behind , the blue waters <unk> flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake ; and on either hand bright bubbles <unk> and <unk> by his side .
But these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly <unk> the sea , <unk> with their <unk> flight ; and like to some <unk> rising from the painted hull of an <unk> , the tall but shattered pole of a <unk> lance <unk> from the white whale ’ s back ; and at intervals one of the <unk> of <unk> fowls hovering , and to and fro <unk> like a <unk> over the fish , silently perched and rocked on this pole , the long tail <unk> <unk> like <unk> .
A gentle <unk> — a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness , invested the gliding whale .
Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with <unk> <unk> clinging to his <unk> horns ; his lovely , <unk> eyes sideways intent upon the <unk> ; with smooth <unk> <unk> , <unk> straight for the <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; not Jove , not that great majesty <unk> !
did <unk> the <unk> White Whale as he so <unk> swam .
On each soft side — <unk> with the parted swell , that but once leaving him , then flowed so wide away — on each bright side , the whale shed off <unk> .
No wonder there had been some among the hunters who <unk> <unk> and <unk> by all this serenity , had <unk> to <unk> it ; but had <unk> found that quietude but the <unk> of <unk> .
Yet calm , <unk> calm , oh , whale !
thou <unk> on , to all who for the first time eye thee , no matter how many in that same way thou may ’ st have <unk> and destroyed before .
And thus , through the serene <unk> of the tropical sea , among waves whose <unk> were suspended by exceeding <unk> , Moby Dick moved on , still <unk> from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk , entirely <unk> the wrenched <unk> of his jaw .
But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water ; for an instant his whole <unk> body formed a high <unk> , like Virginia ’ s Natural <unk> , and <unk> waving his <unk> flukes in the air , the grand god revealed himself , sounded , and went out of sight .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> on the wing , the white <unk> <unk> lingered over the agitated pool that he left .
With oars <unk> , and <unk> down , the sheets of their sails adrift , the three boats now <unk> floated , awaiting Moby Dick ’ s <unk> .
“ An hour , ” said Ahab , standing rooted in his boat ’ s stern ; and he gazed beyond the whale ’ s place , towards the dim blue spaces and wide <unk> <unk> to leeward .
It was only an instant ; for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle .
The breeze now <unk> ; the sea began to swell .
“ The birds ! — the birds ! ” cried Tashtego .
In long Indian file , as when <unk> take wing , the white birds were now all flying towards Ahab ’ s boat ; and when within a few yards began <unk> over the water there , wheeling round and round , with <unk> , <unk> cries .
Their vision was <unk> than man ’ s ; Ahab could discover no sign in the sea .
But suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths , he <unk> saw a white living spot no <unk> than a white <unk> , with wonderful <unk> uprising , and <unk> as it rose , till it turned , and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white , glistening teeth , floating up from the <unk> bottom .
It was Moby Dick ’ s open mouth and <unk> jaw ; his vast , <unk> bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea .
The glittering mouth <unk> beneath the boat like an <unk> marble tomb ; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar , Ahab <unk> the craft aside from this tremendous apparition .
Then , calling upon Fedallah to change places with him , went forward to the bows , and seizing Perth ’ s harpoon , commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern .
Now , by reason of this <unk> spinning round the boat upon its axis , its bow , by <unk> , was made to face the whale ’ s head while yet under water .
But as if <unk> this <unk> , Moby Dick , with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him , <unk> <unk> himself , as it were , in an instant , shooting his <unk> head lengthwise beneath the boat .
Through and through ; through every plank and each rib , it <unk> for an instant , the whale obliquely lying on his back , in the manner of a biting shark , slowly and <unk> taking its bows full within his mouth , so that the long , narrow , <unk> lower jaw curled high up into the open air , and one of the teeth caught in a <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab ’ s head , and reached higher than that .
In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel <unk> her <unk> .
With <unk> eyes Fedallah gazed , and crossed his arms ; but the <unk> crew were <unk> over each other ’ s heads to gain the uttermost stern .
And now , while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out , as the whale <unk> with the <unk> craft in this devilish way ; and from his body being submerged beneath the boat , he could not be darted at from the bows , for the bows were almost inside of him , as it were ; and while the other boats involuntarily paused , as before a quick <unk> impossible to withstand , then it was that monomaniac Ahab , furious with this <unk> vicinity of his foe , which placed him all alive and <unk> in the very jaws he hated ; <unk> with all this , he seized the long bone with his naked hands , and wildly strove to <unk> it from its <unk> .
As now he thus vainly strove , the jaw slipped from him ; the <unk> gunwales bent in , <unk> , and snapped , as both jaws , like an enormous <unk> , sliding further aft , bit the craft completely in twain , and locked themselves fast again in the sea , midway between the two floating <unk> .
These floated aside , the broken ends drooping , the crew at the <unk> clinging to the gunwales , and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across .
At that <unk> moment , ere the boat was yet snapped , Ahab , the first to perceive the whale ’ s intent , by the <unk> <unk> of his head , a movement that <unk> his hold for the time ; at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the <unk> .
But only slipping further into the whale ’ s mouth , and <unk> over sideways as it slipped , the boat had <unk> off his hold on the jaw ; spilled him out of it , as he leaned to the push ; and so he fell <unk> upon the sea .
<unk> withdrawing from his prey , Moby Dick now lay at a little distance , <unk> thrusting his <unk> white head up and down in the billows ; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole <unk> body ; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose — some twenty or more feet out of the water — the now rising swells , with all their <unk> waves , <unk> broke against it ; <unk> tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air .
* So , in a gale , the but half <unk> <unk> billows only <unk> from the base of the <unk> , <unk> to <unk> its summit with their scud .
* This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale .
It <unk> its <unk> ( pitchpoling ) from its being likened to that preliminary <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , in the <unk> called pitchpoling , previously described .
By this motion the whale must best and most <unk> view whatever objects may be <unk> him .
But soon resuming his horizontal attitude , Moby Dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew ; sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake , as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault .
The sight of the splintered boat seemed to <unk> him , as the blood of <unk> and <unk> cast before <unk> ’ s elephants in the book of <unk> .
Meanwhile Ahab half <unk> in the foam of the whale ’ s <unk> tail , and too much of a <unk> to swim , — though he could still keep afloat , even in the heart of such a <unk> as that ; <unk> Ahab ’ s head was seen , like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst .
From the boat ’ s <unk> stern , Fedallah <unk> and mildly eyed him ; the clinging crew , at the other <unk> end , could not <unk> him ; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves .
For so <unk> appalling was the White Whale ’ s aspect , and so <unk> swift the <unk> circles he made , that he seemed horizontally <unk> upon them .
And though the other boats , unharmed , still hovered hard by ; still they dared not pull into the <unk> to strike , lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the <unk> <unk> , Ahab and all ; nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape .
With straining eyes , then , they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone , whose centre had now become the old man ’ s head .
Meantime , from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship ’ s mast heads ; and <unk> her yards , she had borne down upon the scene ; and was now so nigh , that Ahab in the water hailed her ! — “ Sail on the ” — but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick , and <unk> him for the time .
But struggling out of it again , and chancing to rise on a <unk> <unk> , he shouted , — “ Sail on the whale ! — <unk> him off ! ” The Pequod ’ s <unk> were pointed ; and breaking up the <unk> circle , she <unk> parted the white whale from his <unk> .
As he <unk> swam off , the boats flew to the rescue .
<unk> into Stubb ’ s boat with <unk> , <unk> eyes , the white brine <unk> in his wrinkles ; the long <unk> of Ahab ’ s bodily strength did crack , and <unk> he <unk> to his body ’ s doom : for a time , lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb ’ s boat , like one <unk> under foot of herds of elephants .
Far inland , nameless <unk> came from him , as <unk> sounds from out <unk> .
But this intensity of his physical <unk> did but so much the more <unk> it .
In an instant ’ s compass , great hearts sometimes <unk> to one deep <unk> , the sum <unk> of those <unk> pains <unk> <unk> through <unk> men ’ s whole lives .
And so , such hearts , though <unk> in each one suffering ; still , if the gods <unk> it , in their <unk> <unk> a whole age of woe , wholly made up of instantaneous <unk> ; for even in their <unk> <unk> , those noble <unk> contain the entire <unk> of inferior souls .
“ The harpoon , ” said Ahab , half way rising , and <unk> leaning on one <unk> arm — “ is it safe ? ” “ Aye , sir , for it was not darted ; this is it , ” said Stubb , showing it .
“ Lay it before me ; — any missing men ? ” “ One , two , three , four , five ; — there were five oars , sir , and here are five men . ” “ That ’ s good . — <unk> me , man ; I wish to stand .
So , so , I see him !
there !
there !
going to leeward still ; what a leaping spout ! — Hands off from me !
The eternal <unk> runs up in Ahab ’ s bones again !
<unk> the sail ; out oars ; the helm ! ” It is often the case that when a boat is stove , its crew , being picked up by another boat , help to work that second boat ; and the chase is thus continued with what is called <unk> oars .
It was thus now .
But the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale , for he seemed to have <unk> his every fin ; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed , that if now , under these circumstances , pushed on , the chase would prove an <unk> prolonged , if not a hopeless one ; nor could any crew endure for so long a period , such an <unk> , intense straining at the oar ; a thing <unk> tolerable only in some one brief <unk> .
The ship itself , then , as it sometimes happens , offered the most promising <unk> means of <unk> the chase .
<unk> , the boats now made for her , and were soon swayed up to their <unk> — the two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her — and then hoisting everything to her side , and <unk> her canvas high up , and sideways <unk> it with <unk> , like the <unk> wings of an albatross ; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of <unk> .
At the well known , <unk> intervals , the whale ’ s glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mast-heads ; and when he would be reported as just gone down , Ahab would take the time , and then pacing the deck , <unk> in hand , so soon as the last second of the <unk> hour <unk> , his voice was heard . — “ <unk> is the doubloon now ?
D ’ ye see him ? ” and if the reply was , No , sir !
straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch .
In this way the day wore on ; Ahab , now aloft and motionless ; anon , <unk> pacing the planks .
As he was thus walking , <unk> no sound , except to hail the men aloft , or to bid them hoist a sail still higher , or to spread one to a still greater breadth — thus to and fro pacing , beneath his slouched hat , at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat , which had been dropped upon the quarter-deck , and lay there <unk> ; broken bow to shattered stern .
At last he paused before it ; and as in an already <unk> sky fresh <unk> of clouds will sometimes sail across , so over the old man ’ s face there now stole some such added gloom as this .
Stubb saw him pause ; and perhaps <unk> , not vainly , though , to <unk> his own <unk> fortitude , and thus keep up a valiant place in his Captain ’ s mind , he advanced , and eyeing the wreck exclaimed — “ The <unk> the <unk> <unk> ; it <unk> his mouth too <unk> , sir ; ha !
ha ! ” “ What <unk> thing is this that <unk> before a wreck ?
Man , man !
did I not know thee brave as fearless fire ( and as mechanical ) I could swear thou <unk> a <unk> .
<unk> nor laugh should be heard before a wreck . ” “ Aye , sir , ” said Starbuck drawing near , “ ’ tis a solemn sight ; an omen , and an ill one . ” “ <unk> ?
omen ? — the <unk> !
If the gods think to speak <unk> to man , they will <unk> speak <unk> ; not shake their heads , and give an old wives ’ <unk> hint . — <unk> !
Ye two are the opposite poles of one thing ; Starbuck is Stubb <unk> , and Stubb is Starbuck ; and ye two are all mankind ; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the <unk> earth , nor gods nor men his <unk> !
<unk> , cold — I shiver ! — How now ?
Aloft there !
D ’ ye see him ?
Sing out for every spout , though he spout ten times a second ! ” The day was nearly done ; only the <unk> of his golden <unk> was <unk> .
Soon , it was almost dark , but the look-out men still remained <unk> .
“ Can ’ t see the spout now , sir ; — too dark ” — cried a voice from the air .
“ How heading when last seen ? ” “ As before , sir , — straight to leeward . ” “ Good !
he will travel <unk> now ’ tis night .
Down <unk> and top-gallant <unk> , Mr. Starbuck .
We must not run over him before morning ; he ’ s making a passage now , and may <unk> a while .
<unk> there !
keep her full before the wind ! — Aloft !
come down ! — Mr.
Stubb , send a fresh hand to the <unk> head , and see it manned till morning . ” — Then advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast — “ Men , this gold is mine , for I <unk> it ; but I shall let it <unk> here till the White Whale is dead ; and then , <unk> of ye first raises him , upon the day he shall be killed , this gold is that man ’ s ; and if on that day I shall again raise him , then , ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye !
Away now ! — the deck is thine , sir ! ” And so saying , he placed himself half way within the scuttle , and <unk> his hat , stood there till dawn , except when at intervals <unk> himself to see how the night wore on .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Chase — Second Day .
At <unk> , the three mast-heads were <unk> manned <unk> .
“ D ’ ye see him ? ” cried Ahab after <unk> a little space for the light to spread .
“ See nothing , sir . ” “ Turn up all hands and make sail !
he <unk> <unk> than I thought for ; — the top-gallant sails ! — aye , they should have been kept on her all night .
But no matter — ’ tis but resting for the rush . ” Here be it said , that this <unk> pursuit of one particular whale , continued through day into night , and through night into day , is a thing by no means <unk> in the South sea fishery .
For such is the wonderful skill , <unk> of experience , and <unk> confidence <unk> by some great natural <unk> among the Nantucket <unk> ; that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried , they will , under certain given circumstances , pretty <unk> <unk> both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time , while out of sight , as well as his probable rate of <unk> during that period .
And , in these cases , somewhat as a pilot , when about losing sight of a coast , whose general <unk> he well knows , and which he desires shortly to return to again , but at some further point ; like as this pilot stands by his compass , and takes the precise bearing of the <unk> at present visible , in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote , unseen <unk> , eventually to be visited : so does the fisherman , at his compass , with the whale ; for after being chased , and diligently marked , through several hours of daylight , then , when night <unk> the fish , the creature ’ s future wake through the darkness is almost as <unk> to the sagacious mind of the hunter , as the pilot ’ s coast is to him .
So that to this hunter ’ s wondrous skill , the <unk> <unk> of a thing <unk> in water , a wake , is to all desired <unk> well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land .
And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern <unk> is so familiarly known in its every pace , that , with watches in their hands , men time his rate as doctors that of a baby ’ s <unk> ; and lightly say of it , the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot , at such or such an hour ; even so , almost , there are occasions when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep , according to the observed humor of his speed ; and say to themselves , so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles , will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude .
But to render this <unk> at all successful in the end , the wind and the sea must be the whaleman ’ s <unk> ; for of what present <unk> to the <unk> or <unk> mariner is the skill that <unk> him he is exactly <unk> leagues and a quarter from his port ?
<unk> from these statements , are many <unk> <unk> matters touching the chase of whales .
The ship tore on ; leaving such a <unk> in the sea as when a <unk> , <unk> , becomes a <unk> and turns up the level field .
“ By salt and hemp ! ” cried Stubb , “ but this swift motion of the deck <unk> up one ’ s legs and <unk> at the heart .
This ship and I are two brave fellows ! — Ha , ha !
Some one take me up , and <unk> me , <unk> , on the sea , — for by <unk> !
my spine ’ s a keel .
Ha , ha !
we go the <unk> that leaves no dust behind ! ” “ There she blows — she blows ! — she blows ! — right ahead ! ” was now the mast-head cry .
“ Aye , aye ! ” cried Stubb , “ I knew it — ye can ’ t escape — blow on and split your spout , O whale !
the mad fiend himself is after ye !
blow your <unk> — <unk> your lungs ! — Ahab will dam off your blood , as a <unk> <unk> his <unk> upon the stream ! ” And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew .
The <unk> of the chase had by this time worked them <unk> up , like old wine worked anew .
<unk> pale fears and <unk> some of them might have felt before ; these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of Ahab , but they were broken up , and on all sides <unk> , as timid prairie <unk> that <unk> before the <unk> <unk> .
The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls ; and by the <unk> perils of the previous day ; the rack of the past night ’ s <unk> ; the fixed , <unk> , blind , reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark ; by all these things , their hearts were <unk> along .
The wind that made great bellies of their sails , and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible ; this seemed the symbol of that unseen <unk> which so <unk> them to the race .
They were one man , not thirty .
For as the one ship that held them all ; though it was put together of all contrasting things — oak , and <unk> , and pine wood ; iron , and pitch , and hemp — yet all these ran into each other in the one <unk> hull , which shot on its way , both <unk> and directed by the long central keel ; even so , all the <unk> of the crew , this man ’ s <unk> , that man ’ s fear ; <unk> and <unk> , all varieties were welded into <unk> , and were all directed to that fatal <unk> which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to .
The rigging lived .
The mast-heads , like the <unk> of tall palms , were <unk> tufted with arms and legs .
<unk> to a spar with one hand , some reached forth the other with impatient <unk> ; others , <unk> their eyes from the vivid sunlight , sat far out on the rocking yards ; all the spars in full bearing of mortals , ready and ripe for their fate .
Ah !
how they still strove through that infinite <unk> to seek out the thing that might destroy them !
“ Why sing ye not out for him , if ye see him ? ” cried Ahab , when , after the <unk> of some minutes since the first cry , no more had been heard .
“ <unk> me up , men ; ye have been <unk> ; not Moby Dick <unk> one odd jet that way , and then <unk> . ” It was even so ; in their headlong eagerness , the men had mistaken some other thing for the <unk> , as the event itself soon proved ; for hardly had Ahab reached his perch ; hardly was the rope <unk> to its pin on deck , when he struck the <unk> to an <unk> , that made the air <unk> as with the combined <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of thirty <unk> lungs was heard , as — much nearer to the ship than the place of the <unk> jet , less than a mile ahead — Moby Dick bodily burst into view !
For not by any calm and indolent spoutings ; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head , did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity ; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of <unk> .
<unk> with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths , the Sperm Whale thus <unk> his entire bulk into the pure element of air , and <unk> up a mountain of <unk> foam , shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more .
In those moments , the torn , enraged waves he shakes off , seem his <unk> ; in some cases , this <unk> is his act of <unk> .
“ There she breaches !
there she breaches ! ” was the cry , as in his <unk> <unk> the White Whale tossed himself <unk> to Heaven .
So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea , and relieved against the still <unk> margin of the sky , the spray that he raised , for the moment , <unk> <unk> and <unk> like a <unk> ; and stood there gradually <unk> and <unk> away from its first sparkling intensity , to the dim <unk> of an advancing shower in a <unk> .
“ Aye , <unk> your last to the sun , Moby Dick ! ” cried Ahab , “ thy hour and thy harpoon are at hand ! — Down !
down all of ye , but one man at the fore .
The boats ! — stand by ! ” <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the shrouds , the men , like shooting stars , slid to the deck , by the isolated <unk> and <unk> ; while Ahab , less <unk> , but still rapidly was dropped from his perch .
“ Lower away , ” he cried , so soon as he had reached his boat — a spare one , rigged the afternoon previous .
“ Mr.
Starbuck , the ship is thine — keep away from the boats , but keep near them .
Lower , all ! ” As if to strike a quick terror into them , by this time being the first <unk> himself , Moby Dick had turned , and was now coming for the three crews .
Ahab ’ s boat was central ; and cheering his men , he told them he would take the whale <unk> , — that is , pull straight up to his forehead , — a not uncommon thing ; for when within a certain limit , such a course <unk> the coming onset from the whale ’ s sidelong vision .
But ere that close limit was gained , and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship ’ s three masts to his eye ; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed , almost in an instant as it were , rushing among the boats with open jaws , and a lashing tail , offered appalling battle on every side ; and <unk> of the irons darted at him from every boat , seemed only intent on <unk> each separate plank of which those boats were made .
But <unk> <unk> , <unk> wheeling like <unk> <unk> in the field ; the boats for a while <unk> him ; though , at times , but by a plank ’ s breadth ; while all the time , Ahab ’ s unearthly <unk> tore every other cry but his to shreds .
But at last in his <unk> <unk> , the White Whale so crossed and <unk> , and in a thousand ways entangled the <unk> of the three lines now fast to him , that they <unk> , and , of themselves , <unk> the <unk> boats towards the planted irons in him ; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little , as if to <unk> for a more tremendous charge .
<unk> that opportunity , Ahab first paid out more line : and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again — <unk> that way to <unk> it of some <unk> — when lo ! — a sight more savage than the <unk> teeth of sharks !
<unk> and twisted — <unk> in the <unk> of the line , loose harpoons and lances , with all their <unk> barbs and points , came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab ’ s boat .
Only one thing could be done .
<unk> the <unk> , he <unk> reached within — through — and then , without — the rays of steel ; dragged in the line beyond , passed it , <unk> , to the bowsman , and then , twice <unk> the rope near the chocks — dropped the <unk> <unk> of steel into the sea ; and was all fast again .
That instant , the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining <unk> of the other lines ; by so doing , <unk> dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes ; dashed them together like two rolling <unk> on a <unk> beach , and then , diving down into the sea , disappeared in a boiling <unk> , in which , for a space , the <unk> cedar chips of the <unk> <unk> round and round , like the <unk> <unk> in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch .
While the two crews were yet <unk> in the waters , reaching out after the revolving <unk> , oars , and other floating furniture , while <unk> little Flask <unk> up and down like an empty vial , <unk> his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks ; and Stubb was <unk> singing out for some one to <unk> him up ; and while the old man ’ s line — now <unk> — <unk> of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could ; — in that wild <unk> of a thousand <unk> perils , — Ahab ’ s yet <unk> boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven by invisible <unk> , — as , <unk> , shooting perpendicularly from the sea , the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom , and sent it , turning over and over , into the air ; till it fell again — gunwale downwards — and Ahab and his men <unk> out from under it , like seals from a <unk> cave .
The first uprising <unk> of the whale — <unk> its direction as he struck the surface — involuntarily launched him along it , to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made ; and with his back to it , he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side ; and whenever a <unk> oar , bit of plank , the least chip or <unk> of the boats touched his skin , his tail swiftly drew back , and came sideways smiting the sea .
But soon , as if satisfied that his work for that time was done , he pushed his <unk> forehead through the ocean , and <unk> after him the <unk> lines , continued his leeward way at a traveller ’ s <unk> pace .
As before , the <unk> ship having descried the whole fight , again came bearing down to the rescue , and dropping a boat , picked up the floating mariners , tubs , oars , and whatever else could be caught at , and safely landed them on her decks .
Some <unk> shoulders , wrists , and <unk> ; <unk> <unk> ; wrenched harpoons and lances ; <unk> <unk> of rope ; shattered oars and planks ; all these were there ; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have <unk> any one .
As with Fedallah the day before , so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat ’ s broken half , which afforded a comparatively easy float ; nor did it so <unk> him as the previous day ’ s <unk> .
But when he was helped to the deck , all eyes were fastened upon him ; as instead of standing by himself he still <unk> upon the shoulder of Starbuck , who had thus far been the foremost to <unk> him .
His ivory leg had been snapped off , leaving but one short sharp <unk> .
“ Aye , aye , Starbuck , ’ tis sweet to lean sometimes , be the <unk> who he will ; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has . ” “ The <unk> has not stood , sir , ” said the carpenter , now coming up ; “ I put good work into that leg . ” “ But no bones broken , sir , I hope , ” said Stubb with true concern .
“ Aye !
and all splintered to pieces , Stubb ! — d ’ ye see it . — But even with a broken bone , old Ahab is <unk> ; and I account no living bone of mine one jot more me , than this dead one that ’ s lost .
Nor white whale , nor man , nor fiend , can so much as <unk> old Ahab in his own proper and <unk> being .
Can any lead touch yonder floor , any mast scrape yonder <unk> ? — Aloft there !
which way ? ” “ <unk> to leeward , sir . ” “ Up helm , then ; pile on the sail again , ship <unk> !
down the rest of the spare boats and rig them — Mr.
Starbuck away , and <unk> the boat ’ s crews . ” “ Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks , sir . ” “ Oh , oh , oh !
how this <unk> <unk> me now !
<unk> fate !
that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate ! ” “ Sir ? ” “ My body , man , not thee .
Give me something for a cane — there , that shivered lance will do .
<unk> the men .
Surely I have not seen him yet .
By heaven it cannot be ! — missing ? — quick !
call them all . ” The old man ’ s hinted thought was true .
Upon <unk> the company , the Parsee was not there .
“ The Parsee ! ” cried Stubb — “ he must have been caught in — — ” “ The black <unk> <unk> thee ! — run all of ye above , <unk> , cabin , forecastle — find him — not gone — not gone ! ” But quickly they returned to him with the <unk> that the Parsee was nowhere to be found .
“ Aye , sir , ” said Stubb — “ caught among the <unk> of your line — I thought I saw him dragging under . ” “ _ My _ line !
_ my _ line ?
<unk> ? — gone ?
What means that little word ? — What <unk> rings in it , that old Ahab shakes as if he were the <unk> .
The harpoon , too ! — toss over the <unk> there , — d ’ ye see it ? — the forged iron , men , the white whale ’ s — no , no , no , — <unk> fool !
this hand did dart it ! — ’ tis in the fish ! — Aloft there !
<unk> him nailed — Quick ! — all hands to the rigging of the boats — <unk> the oars — harpooneers !
the irons , the irons ! — hoist the <unk> higher — a pull on all the sheets ! — helm there !
steady , steady for your life !
I ’ ll ten times <unk> the <unk> globe ; yea and dive straight through it , but I ’ ll slay him yet ! ” “ Great God !
but for one single instant show thyself , ” cried Starbuck ; “ never , never wilt thou capture him , old man — In <unk> ’ name no more of this , that ’ s worse than devil ’ s madness .
Two days chased ; twice stove to splinters ; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee ; thy evil shadow gone — all good angels <unk> thee with <unk> : — what more <unk> thou have ? — Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he <unk> the last man ?
Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea ?
Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world ?
Oh , oh , — <unk> and <unk> to hunt him more ! ” “ Starbuck , of late I ’ ve felt strangely moved to thee ; ever since that hour we both saw — thou know ’ st what , in one another ’ s eyes .
But in this matter of the whale , be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this hand — a <unk> , <unk> blank .
Ahab is for ever Ahab , man .
This whole act ’ s <unk> <unk> .
’ <unk> <unk> by thee and me a <unk> years before this ocean rolled .
<unk> !
I am the Fates ’ <unk> ; I act under orders .
Look thou , <unk> !
that thou <unk> mine . — Stand round me , men .
Ye see an old man cut down to the stump ; leaning on a shivered lance ; <unk> up on a lonely foot .
’ Tis Ahab — his body ’ s part ; but Ahab ’ s soul ’ s a <unk> , that <unk> upon a hundred legs .
I feel strained , half stranded , as ropes that tow dismasted <unk> in a gale ; and I may look so .
But ere I break , ye ’ ll hear me crack ; and till ye hear _ that _ , know that Ahab ’ s <unk> <unk> his purpose yet .
<unk> ye , men , in the things called <unk> ?
Then laugh <unk> , and cry <unk> !
For ere they drown , <unk> things will twice rise to the surface ; then rise again , to sink for <unk> .
So with Moby Dick — two days he ’ s floated — <unk> will be the third .
Aye , men , he ’ ll rise once more , — but only to spout his last !
D ’ ye feel brave men , brave ? ” “ As fearless fire , ” cried Stubb .
“ And as mechanical , ” muttered Ahab .
Then as the men went forward , he muttered on : “ The things called <unk> !
And yesterday I talked the same to Starbuck there , concerning my broken boat .
Oh !
how <unk> I seek to drive out of others ’ hearts what ’ s <unk> so fast in mine ! — The Parsee — the Parsee ! — gone , gone ?
and he was to go before : — but still was to be seen again ere I could <unk> — How ’ s that ? — There ’ s a <unk> now might <unk> all the <unk> backed by the ghosts of the whole line of <unk> : — like a <unk> ’ s <unk> it <unk> my brain .
_ I ’ ll _ , _ I ’ ll _ <unk> it , though ! ” When <unk> descended , the whale was still in sight to leeward .
So once more the sail was <unk> , and everything passed nearly as on the previous night ; only , the sound of hammers , and the hum of the <unk> was heard till nearly daylight , as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and <unk> their fresh weapons for the <unk> .
Meantime , of the broken keel of Ahab ’ s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg ; while still as on the night before , slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle ; his <unk> , <unk> glance <unk> gone backward on its <unk> ; sat due eastward for the <unk> sun .
CHAPTER <unk> .
The Chase . — Third Day .
The morning of the third day <unk> fair and fresh , and once more the solitary <unk> at the <unk> was relieved by crowds of the daylight look-outs , who dotted every mast and almost every spar .
“ D ’ ye see him ? ” cried Ahab ; but the whale was not yet in sight .
“ In his infallible wake , though ; but follow that wake , that ’ s all .
<unk> there ; steady , as thou <unk> , and hast been going .
What a lovely day again !
were it a <unk> world , and made for a <unk> to the angels , and this morning the first of its throwing open to them , a <unk> day could not dawn upon that world .
Here ’ s food for thought , had Ahab time to think ; but Ahab never thinks ; he only feels , feels , feels ; _ that ’ s _ <unk> enough for mortal man !
to think ’ s <unk> .
God only has that right and privilege .
<unk> is , or ought to be , a <unk> and a <unk> ; and our poor hearts <unk> , and our poor brains beat too much for that .
And yet , I ’ ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm — frozen calm , this old skull cracks so , like a glass in which the contents turned to ice , and shiver it .
And still this hair is growing now ; this moment growing , and heat must <unk> it ; but no , it ’ s like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere , between the <unk> <unk> of Greenland ice or in <unk> <unk> .
How the wild winds blow it ; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they <unk> to .
A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> them , and now comes blowing hither as innocent as <unk> .
Out upon it ! — it ’ s <unk> .
Were I the wind , I ’ d blow no more on such a wicked , miserable world .
I ’ d crawl somewhere to a cave , and <unk> there .
And yet , ’ tis a noble and <unk> thing , the wind !
who ever <unk> it ?
In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow .
<unk> <unk> at it , and you but run through it .
Ha !
a coward wind that strikes stark naked men , but will not stand to receive a single blow .
Even Ahab is a <unk> thing — a <unk> thing than _ that _ .
Would now the wind but had a body ; but all the things that most <unk> and <unk> mortal man , all these things are <unk> , but only <unk> as objects , not as <unk> .
There ’ s a most special , a most cunning , oh , a most malicious difference !
And yet , I say again , and swear it now , that there ’ s something all glorious and gracious in the wind .
These warm <unk> <unk> , at least , that in the clear heavens blow straight on , in strong and steadfast , vigorous mildness ; and <unk> not from their mark , however the <unk> currents of the sea may turn and <unk> , and mightiest <unk> of the land swift and <unk> about , uncertain where to go at last .
And by the eternal <unk> !
these same <unk> that so directly blow my good ship on ; these <unk> , or something like them — something so <unk> , and full as strong , blow my <unk> soul along !
To it !
Aloft there !
What d ’ ye see ? ” “ Nothing , sir . ” “ Nothing !
and noon at hand !
The doubloon goes <unk> !
See the sun !
Aye , aye , it must be so .
I ’ ve <unk> him .
How , got the start ?
Aye , he ’ s chasing _ me _ now ; not I , _ him _ — that ’ s bad ; I might have known it , too .
<unk> !
the lines — the harpoons he ’ s towing .
Aye , aye , I have run him by last night .
About !
about !
Come down , all of ye , but the regular look <unk> !
Man the braces ! ” <unk> as she had done , the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod ’ s quarter , so that now being pointed in the <unk> direction , the <unk> ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she <unk> the <unk> in her own white wake .
“ <unk> the wind he now <unk> for the open jaw , ” murmured Starbuck to himself , as he coiled the <unk> <unk> upon the rail .
“ God keep us , but already my bones feel damp within me , and from the inside wet my flesh .
I <unk> me that I <unk> my God in obeying him ! ” “ Stand by to sway me up ! ” cried Ahab , advancing to the hempen basket .
“ We should meet him soon . ” “ Aye , aye , sir , ” and straightway Starbuck did Ahab ’ s bidding , and once more Ahab swung on high .
A whole hour now passed ; <unk> out to ages .
Time itself now held long breaths with keen <unk> .
But at last , some three points off the weather bow , Ahab descried the spout again , and instantly from the three mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the <unk> of fire had <unk> it .
“ <unk> to forehead I meet thee , this third time , Moby Dick !
On deck there ! — brace <unk> up ; crowd her into the wind ’ s eye .
He ’ s too far off to lower yet , Mr. Starbuck .
The sails shake !
Stand over that helmsman with a top-maul !
So , so ; he <unk> fast , and I must down .
But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea ; there ’ s time for that .
An old , old sight , and yet somehow so young ; aye , and not changed a <unk> since I first saw it , a boy , from the <unk> of Nantucket !
The same ! — the same ! — the same to Noah as to me .
There ’ s a soft shower to leeward .
Such lovely <unk> !
They must lead somewhere — to something else than common land , more <unk> than the palms .
<unk> !
the white whale goes that way ; look to windward , then ; the better if the <unk> quarter .
But good <unk> , good <unk> , old mast-head !
What ’ s this ? — green ?
aye , <unk> <unk> in these <unk> cracks .
No such green weather <unk> on Ahab ’ s head !
There ’ s the difference now between man ’ s old age and matter ’ s .
But aye , old mast , we both grow old together ; sound in our hulls , though , are we not , my ship ?
Aye , <unk> a leg , that ’ s all .
By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way .
I can ’ t compare with it ; and I ’ ve known some ships made of dead trees <unk> the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers .
What ’ s that he said ?
he should still go before me , my pilot ; and yet to be seen again ?
But where ?
Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea , <unk> I descend those endless stairs ?
and all night I ’ ve been sailing from him , wherever he did sink to .
Aye , aye , like many more thou told ’ st direful truth as touching thyself , O Parsee ; but , Ahab , there thy shot fell short .
Good-bye , mast-head — keep a good eye upon the whale , the while I ’ m gone .
We ’ ll talk to-morrow , nay , to-night , when the white whale lies down there , tied by head and tail . ” He gave the word ; and still gazing round him , was steadily lowered through the <unk> blue air to the deck .
In due time the boats were lowered ; but as standing in his <unk> ’ s stern , Ahab just hovered upon the point of the <unk> , he waved to the mate , — who held one of the <unk> on deck — and bade him pause .
“ Starbuck ! ” “ Sir ? ” “ For the third time my soul ’ s ship <unk> upon this voyage , Starbuck . ” “ Aye , sir , thou wilt have it so . ” “ Some ships sail from their ports , and ever afterwards are missing , Starbuck ! ” “ Truth , sir : <unk> truth . ” “ Some men die at <unk> tide ; some at low water ; some at the full of the flood ; — and I feel now like a billow that ’ s all one <unk> <unk> , Starbuck .
I am old ; — shake hands with me , man . ” Their hands met ; their eyes fastened ; Starbuck ’ s tears the <unk> .
“ Oh , my captain , my captain ! — noble heart — go not — go not ! — see , it ’ s a brave man that <unk> ; how great the agony of the <unk> then ! ” “ Lower away ! ” — cried Ahab , tossing the mate ’ s arm from him .
“ Stand by the crew ! ” In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern .
“ The sharks !
the sharks ! ” cried a voice from the low <unk> there ; “ O master , my master , come back ! ” But Ahab heard nothing ; for his own voice was <unk> then ; and the boat leaped on .
Yet the voice <unk> true ; for scarce had he pushed from the ship , when numbers of sharks , seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull , <unk> snapped at the blades of the oars , every time they <unk> in the water ; and in this way accompanied the boat with their <unk> .
It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the <unk> in those <unk> seas ; the sharks at times apparently following them in the same <unk> way that <unk> <unk> over the <unk> of marching <unk> in the east .
But these were the first sharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried ; and whether it was that Ahab ’ s crew were all such <unk> <unk> , and therefore their flesh more <unk> to the <unk> of the sharks — a matter sometimes well known to affect them , — however it was , they seemed to follow that one boat without <unk> the others .
“ <unk> of wrought steel ! ” murmured Starbuck gazing over the side , and following with his eyes the <unk> boat — “ canst thou yet ring boldly to that sight ? — lowering thy keel among <unk> sharks , and followed by them , <unk> to the chase ; and this the critical third day ? — For when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit ; be sure the first is the morning , the second the noon , and the third the evening and the end of that thing — be that end what it may .
Oh !
my God !
what is this that <unk> through me , and leaves me so deadly calm , yet <unk> , — fixed at the top of a shudder !
<unk> things swim before me , as in empty <unk> and skeletons ; all the past is somehow grown dim .
Mary , girl !
thou <unk> in pale <unk> behind me ; boy !
I seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue .
<unk> <unk> of life seem clearing ; but clouds sweep between — Is my <unk> ’ s end coming ?
My legs feel faint ; like his who has <unk> it all day .
<unk> thy heart , — <unk> it yet ?
<unk> thyself , Starbuck ! — stave it off — move , move !
speak <unk> ! — <unk> there !
See ye my boy ’ s hand on the hill ? — <unk> ; — aloft there ! — keep thy <unk> eye upon the boats : — mark well the whale ! — Ho !
again ! — drive off that <unk> !
see !
he <unk> — he tears the <unk> ” — pointing to the red flag flying at the <unk> — “ Ha !
he <unk> away with it ! — Where ’ s the old man now ?
see ’ st thou that sight , oh Ahab ! — shudder , shudder ! ” The boats had not gone very far , when by a signal from the mast-heads — a downward pointed arm , Ahab knew that the whale had sounded ; but <unk> to be near him at the next rising , he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel ; the <unk> crew <unk> the profoundest silence , as the <unk> waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow .
“ <unk> , drive in your nails , oh ye waves !
to their uttermost heads drive them in !
ye but strike a thing without a lid ; and no coffin and no hearse can be mine : — and hemp only can kill me !
Ha !
ha ! ” Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles ; then quickly <unk> , as if sideways sliding from a submerged <unk> of ice , swiftly rising to the surface .
A low <unk> sound was heard ; a <unk> hum ; and then all held their breaths ; as <unk> with <unk> ropes , and harpoons , and lances , a vast form shot lengthwise , but obliquely from the sea .
<unk> in a thin drooping veil of mist , it hovered for a moment in the <unk> air ; and then fell <unk> back into the deep .
<unk> thirty feet upwards , the waters <unk> for an instant like heaps of <unk> , then <unk> sank in a shower of <unk> , leaving the <unk> surface <unk> like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale .
“ Give way ! ” cried Ahab to the oarsmen , and the boats darted forward to the attack ; but maddened by yesterday ’ s fresh irons that <unk> in him , Moby Dick seemed <unk> possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven .
The wide <unk> of welded tendons <unk> his broad white forehead , beneath the transparent skin , looked <unk> together ; as head on , he came churning his tail among the boats ; and once more <unk> them apart ; <unk> out the irons and lances from the two mates ’ boats , and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows , but leaving Ahab ’ s almost without a scar .
While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks ; and as the whale swimming out from them , turned , and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again ; at that moment a quick cry went up .
<unk> round and round to the fish ’ s back ; <unk> in the turns upon turns in which , during the past night , the whale had reeled the <unk> of the lines around him , the half torn body of the Parsee was seen ; his sable <unk> <unk> to shreds ; his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab .
The harpoon dropped from his hand .
“ <unk> , <unk> ! ” — drawing in a long lean breath — “ Aye , Parsee !
I see thee again . — Aye , and thou <unk> before ; and this , _ this _ then is the hearse that thou didst promise .
But I hold thee to the last letter of thy word .
Where is the second hearse ?
Away , mates , to the ship !
those boats are useless now ; <unk> them if ye can in time , and return to me ; if not , Ahab is enough to die — Down , men !
the first thing that but <unk> to jump from this boat I stand in , that thing I harpoon .
Ye are not other men , but my arms and my legs ; and so obey me . — Where ’ s the whale ?
gone down again ? ” But he looked too nigh the boat ; for as if bent upon <unk> with the corpse he bore , and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage , Moby Dick was now again steadily swimming forward ; and had almost passed the ship , — which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him , though for the present her headway had been stopped .
He seemed swimming with his utmost velocity , and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea .
“ Oh !
Ahab , ” cried Starbuck , “ not too late is it , even now , the third day , to desist .
See !
Moby Dick seeks thee not .
It is thou , thou , that <unk> <unk> him ! ” <unk> sail to the rising wind , the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to leeward , by both oars and canvas .
And at last when Ahab was sliding by the vessel , so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck ’ s face as he leaned over the rail , he hailed him to turn the vessel about , and follow him , not too swiftly , at a <unk> interval .
<unk> upwards , he saw Tashtego , Queequeg , and Daggoo , eagerly <unk> to the three mast-heads ; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two <unk> boats which had but just been hoisted to the side , and were <unk> at work in <unk> them .
One after the other , through the <unk> , as he <unk> , he also caught flying <unk> of Stubb and Flask , <unk> themselves on deck among <unk> of new irons and lances .
As he saw all this ; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats ; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart .
But he <unk> .
And now <unk> that the <unk> or flag was gone from the <unk> , he shouted to Tashtego , who had just gained that perch , to descend again for another flag , and a hammer and nails , and so nail it to the mast .
Whether <unk> by the three days ’ running chase , and the <unk> to his swimming in the knotted <unk> he bore ; or whether it was some latent <unk> and malice in him : <unk> was true , the White Whale ’ s way now began to <unk> , as it seemed , from the boat so rapidly <unk> him once more ; though indeed the whale ’ s last start had not been so long a one as before .
And still as Ahab glided over the waves the <unk> sharks accompanied him ; and so <unk> stuck to the boat ; and so continually bit at the <unk> oars , that the blades became <unk> and <unk> , and left small splinters in the sea , at almost every dip .
“ <unk> them not !
those teeth but give new <unk> to your oars .
Pull on !
’ tis the better rest , the shark ’ s jaw than the <unk> water . ” “ But at every <unk> , sir , the thin blades grow smaller and smaller ! ” “ They will last long enough !
pull on ! — But who can tell ” — he muttered — “ whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on Ahab ? — But pull on !
Aye , all alive , now — we near him .
The helm !
take the helm !
let me pass , ” — and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat .
At length as the craft was cast to one side , and ran ranging along with the White Whale ’ s flank , he seemed strangely <unk> of its advance — as the whale sometimes will — and Ahab was fairly within the <unk> mountain mist , which , thrown off from the whale ’ s spout , curled round his great , <unk> hump ; he was even thus close to him ; when , with body arched back , and both arms lengthwise <unk> to the <unk> , he darted his fierce iron , and his far <unk> <unk> into the hated whale .
As both steel and <unk> sank to the socket , as if sucked into a <unk> , Moby Dick sideways <unk> ; <unk> rolled his nigh flank against the bow , and , without <unk> a hole in it , so suddenly <unk> the boat over , that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then <unk> , Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea .
As it was , three of the oarsmen — who <unk> not the precise instant of the dart , and were therefore <unk> for its <unk> — these were flung out ; but so fell , that , in an instant two of them <unk> the gunwale again , and rising to its level on a <unk> wave , hurled themselves bodily <unk> again ; the third man <unk> dropping astern , but still afloat and swimming .
Almost simultaneously , with a mighty volition of <unk> , instantaneous swiftness , the White Whale darted through the <unk> sea .
But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line , and hold it so ; and commanded the crew to turn round on their <unk> , and tow the boat up to the mark ; the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and <unk> , it snapped in the empty air !
“ What breaks in me ?
Some <unk> cracks ! — ’ tis whole again ; oars !
oars !
<unk> in upon him ! ” <unk> the tremendous rush of the <unk> boat , the whale <unk> round to present his blank forehead at bay ; but in that <unk> , catching sight of the <unk> black hull of the ship ; seemingly seeing in it the source of all his <unk> ; bethinking it — it may be — a larger and <unk> foe ; of a sudden , he bore down upon its advancing prow , smiting his jaws amid fiery <unk> of foam .
Ahab <unk> ; his hand smote his forehead .
“ I grow blind ; hands !
stretch out before me that I may yet <unk> my way .
Is ’ t night ? ” “ The whale !
The ship ! ” cried the <unk> oarsmen .
“ <unk> !
oars !
<unk> downwards to thy depths , O sea , that ere it be for ever too late , Ahab may slide this last , last time upon his mark !
I see : the ship !
the ship !
<unk> on , my men !
Will ye not save my ship ? ” But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the <unk> seas , the before <unk> <unk> of two planks burst through , and in an instant almost , the temporarily <unk> boat lay nearly level with the waves ; its <unk> , <unk> crew , trying hard to stop the <unk> and <unk> out the <unk> water .
Meantime , for that one beholding instant , Tashtego ’ s mast-head hammer remained suspended in his hand ; and the red flag , <unk> him as with a <unk> , then <unk> itself straight out from him , as his own <unk> heart ; while Starbuck and Stubb , standing upon the bowsprit beneath , caught sight of the <unk> monster just as soon as he .
“ The whale , the whale !
Up helm , up helm !
Oh , all ye sweet powers of air , now <unk> me close !
Let not Starbuck die , if die he must , in a woman ’ s <unk> fit .
Up helm , I say — ye <unk> , the jaw !
the jaw !
Is this the end of all my bursting prayers ?
all my <unk> <unk> ?
Oh , Ahab , Ahab , lo , thy work .
Steady !
helmsman , steady .
Nay , nay !
Up helm again !
He turns to meet us !
Oh , his <unk> brow <unk> on towards one , whose duty tells him he cannot depart .
My God , stand by me now ! ” “ Stand not by me , but stand under me , whoever you are that will now help Stubb ; for Stubb , too , <unk> here .
I grin at thee , thou grinning whale !
Who ever helped Stubb , or kept Stubb awake , but Stubb ’ s own <unk> eye ?
And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a <unk> that is all too soft ; would it were stuffed with <unk> !
I grin at thee , thou grinning whale !
Look ye , sun , moon , and stars !
I call ye <unk> of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost .
For all that , I would yet ring glasses with ye , would ye but hand the cup !
Oh , oh !
oh , oh !
thou grinning whale , but there ’ ll be plenty of <unk> soon !
Why fly ye not , O Ahab !
For me , off shoes and jacket to it ; let Stubb die in his drawers !
A most mouldy and over salted death , though ; — <unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> !
Oh , Flask , for one red <unk> ere we die ! ” “ <unk> ?
I only wish that we were where they grow .
Oh , Stubb , I hope my poor mother ’ s drawn my <unk> ere this ; if not , few <unk> will now come to her , for the voyage is up . ” From the ship ’ s bows , nearly all the seamen now hung <unk> ; hammers , bits of plank , lances , and harpoons , mechanically retained in their hands , just as they had darted from their various <unk> ; all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale , which from side to side strangely vibrating his <unk> head , sent a broad band of <unk> <unk> foam before him as he rushed .
<unk> , swift vengeance , eternal malice were in his whole aspect , and spite of all that mortal man could do , the solid white <unk> of his forehead smote the ship ’ s starboard bow , till men and timbers reeled .
Some fell flat upon their faces .
Like <unk> <unk> , the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their <unk> <unk> .
Through the <unk> , they heard the waters pour , as mountain <unk> down a <unk> .
“ The ship !
The hearse ! — the second hearse ! ” cried Ahab from the boat ; “ its wood could only be American ! ” <unk> beneath the <unk> ship , the whale ran <unk> along its keel ; but turning under water , swiftly shot to the surface again , far off the other bow , but within a few yards of Ahab ’ s boat , where , for a time , he lay <unk> .
“ I turn my body from the sun .
What ho , Tashtego !
let me hear thy hammer .
Oh !
ye three <unk> spires of mine ; thou <unk> keel ; and only <unk> hull ; thou firm deck , and haughty helm , and <unk> prow , — <unk> ship !
must ye then <unk> , and without me ?
<unk> I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest <unk> captains ?
Oh , lonely death on lonely life !
Oh , now I feel my topmost <unk> lies in my topmost grief .
Ho , ho !
from all your furthest <unk> , pour ye now in , ye bold billows of my whole <unk> life , and top this one piled <unk> of my death !
Towards thee I roll , thou <unk> but <unk> whale ; to the last I <unk> with thee ; from hell ’ s heart I <unk> at thee ; for hate ’ s sake I <unk> my last breath at thee .
<unk> all coffins and all <unk> to one common pool !
and since neither can be mine , let me then tow to pieces , while still chasing thee , though tied to thee , thou damned whale !
_ Thus _ , I give up the spear ! ” The harpoon was darted ; the stricken whale flew forward ; with <unk> velocity the line ran through the grooves ; — ran foul .
Ahab stooped to clear it ; he did clear it ; but the flying turn caught him round the neck , and <unk> as Turkish <unk> <unk> their <unk> , he was shot out of the boat , ere the crew knew he was gone .
Next instant , the heavy <unk> in the rope ’ s final end flew out of the <unk> tub , knocked down an oarsman , and smiting the sea , disappeared in its depths .
For an instant , the <unk> boat ’ s crew stood still ; then turned .
“ The ship ?
Great God , where is the ship ? ” Soon they through dim , <unk> <unk> saw her sidelong <unk> phantom , as in the <unk> <unk> <unk> ; only the <unk> masts out of water ; while fixed by <unk> , or <unk> , or fate , to their once lofty <unk> , the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking <unk> on the sea .
And now , <unk> circles seized the lone boat itself , and all its crew , and each floating oar , and every <unk> , and spinning , <unk> and <unk> , all round and round in one <unk> , carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight .
But as the last <unk> <unk> poured themselves over the sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast , leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible , together with long <unk> yards of the flag , which calmly <unk> , with <unk> <unk> , over the <unk> billows they almost touched ; — at that instant , a red arm and a hammer hovered <unk> uplifted in the open air , in the act of <unk> the flag <unk> and yet <unk> to the <unk> spar .
A <unk> that <unk> had followed the <unk> downwards from its natural home among the stars , <unk> at the flag , and <unk> Tashtego there ; this bird now chanced to <unk> its broad <unk> wing between the hammer and the wood ; and simultaneously feeling that <unk> <unk> , the submerged savage beneath , in his <unk> , kept his hammer frozen there ; and so the bird of heaven , with <unk> shrieks , and his imperial <unk> thrust upwards , and his whole <unk> form folded in the flag of Ahab , went down with his ship , which , like <unk> , would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her , and <unk> herself with it .
Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet <unk> gulf ; a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides ; then all <unk> , and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago .
<unk> “ AND I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> TO <unk> <unk> ” Job .
The <unk> ’ s done .
Why then here does any one step forth ? — Because one did survive the wreck .
It so chanced , that after the Parsee ’ s <unk> , I was he whom the Fates <unk> to take the place of Ahab ’ s bowsman , when that bowsman <unk> the vacant post ; the same , who , when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat , was dropped astern .
So , floating on the margin of the <unk> scene , and in full sight of it , when the <unk> <unk> of the sunk ship reached me , I was then , but slowly , drawn towards the <unk> <unk> .
When I reached it , it had <unk> to a creamy pool .
Round and round , then , and ever <unk> towards the <unk> black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle , like another <unk> I did <unk> .
<unk> , gaining that vital centre , the black bubble upward burst ; and now , <unk> by reason of its cunning spring , and , owing to its great <unk> , rising with great force , the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea , fell over , and floated by my side .
<unk> up by that coffin , for almost one whole day and night , I floated on a soft and <unk> main .
The <unk> sharks , they glided by as if with <unk> on their mouths ; the savage <unk> sailed with <unk> <unk> .
On the second day , a sail drew near , nearer , and picked me up at last .
It was the <unk> Rachel , that in her <unk> search after her missing children , only found another <unk> .
