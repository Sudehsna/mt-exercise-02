But the involvements of her worldly affairs , and of his , delayed the marriage for six years .
To secure fixed income he took a poor office as Librarian at Wolfenbüttel .
In his first year at Wolfenbüttel , he wrote his play of “ Emilia Galotti . ” Then came a long-desired journey to Italy ; but it came in inconvenient form , for it had to be made with Prince Leopold , of Brunswick , hurriedly , for the sake of money , at the time when Lessing was at last able to marry .
The wife , long waited for , and deeply loved , died at the birth of her first child .
This was in January , 1778 , when Lessing ’ s age was 49 .
Very soon afterwards he was attacked by a Pastor Goeze , in Hamburg , and other narrow theologians , for having edited papers that contained an attack on Christianity , which Lessing himself had said that he wished to see answered before he died .
The uncharitable bitterness of these attacks , felt by a mind that had been touched to the quick by the deepest of sorrows , helped to the shaping of Lessing ’ s calm , beautiful lesson of charity , this noblest of his plays — “ Nathan the Wise . ” But Lessing ’ s health was shattered , and he survived his wife only three years .
He died in 1781 , leaving imperishable influence for good upon the minds of men , but so poor in what the world calls wealth , that his funeral had to be paid for by a Duke of Brunswick .
William Taylor , the translator of Lessing ’ s “ Nathan the Wise ; ” was born in 1765 , the son of a rich merchant at Norwich , from whose business he was drawn away by his strong bent towards literature .
His father yielded to his wishes , after long visits to France and to Germany , in days astir with the new movements of thought , that preceded and followed the French Revolution .
He formed a close friendship with Southey , edited for a little time a “ Norwich Iris , ” and in his later years became known especially for his Historic Survey of German Poetry , which included his translations , and among them this of “ Nathan the Wise . ” It was published in 1830 , Taylor died in 1836 .
Thomas Carlyle , in reviewing William Taylor ’ s Survey of German Poetry , said of the author ’ s own translations in it “ compared with the average of British translations , they may be pronounced of almost ideal excellence ; compared with the best translations extant , for example , the German Shakespeare , Homer , Calderon , they may still be called better than indifferent .
One great merit Mr. Taylor has : rigorous adherence to his original ; he endeavours at least to copy with all possible fidelity the term of praise , the tone , the very metre , whatever stands written for him . ” H. M. NATHAN THE WISE .

ACT I. SCENE . — A Hall in Nathan ’ s House .
NATHAN , _ in a travelling dress _ , DAYA _ meeting him _ .
DAYA .
’ Tis he , ’ tis Nathan !
Thanks to the Almighty , That you ’ re at last returned .
NATHAN .
Yes , Daya , thanks , That I have reached Jerusalem in safety .
But wherefore this _ at last _ ?
Did I intend , Or was it possible to come back sooner ?
As I was forced to travel , out and in , ’ Tis a long hundred leagues to Babylon ; And to get in one ’ s debts is no employment , That speeds a traveller .
DAYA .
O Nathan , Nathan , How miserable you had nigh become During this little absence ; for your house — NATHAN .
Well , ’ twas on fire ; I have already heard it .
God grant I may have heard the whole , that chanced !
DAYA .
’ Twas on the point of burning to the ground .
NATHAN .
Then we ’ d have built another , and a better .
DAYA .
True ! — But thy Recha too was on the point Of perishing amid the flames .
NATHAN .
Of perishing ?
My Recha , saidst thou ?
She ?
I heard not that .
I then should not have needed any house .
Upon the point of perishing — perchance She ’ s gone ? — Speak out then — out — torment me not With this suspense . — Come , tell me , tell me all .
DAYA .
Were she no more , from me you would not hear it .
NATHAN .
Why then alarm me ? — Recha , O my Recha !
DAYA .
Your Recha ?
Yours ?
NATHAN .
What if I ever were Doomed to unlearn to call this child , _ my _ child , DAYA .
Is all you own yours by an equal title ?
NATHAN .
Nought by a better .
What I else enjoy Nature and Fortune gave — this treasure , Virtue .
DAYA .
How dear you make me pay for all your goodness ! — If goodness , exercised with such a view , Deserves the name . — NATHAN .
With such a view ?
With what ?
DAYA .
My conscience — NATHAN .
Daya , let me tell you first — DAYA .
I say , my conscience — NATHAN .
What a charming silk I bought for you in Babylon !
’ Tis rich , Yet elegantly rich .
I almost doubt If I have brought a prettier for Recha .
DAYA .
And what of that — I tell you that my conscience Will no be longer hushed .
NATHAN .
And I have bracelets , And earrings , and a necklace , which will charm you .
I chose them at Damascus .
DAYA .
That ’ s your way : — If you can but make presents — but make presents . — NATHAN .
Take you as freely as I give — and cease .
DAYA .
And cease ? — Who questions , Nathan , but that you are Honour and generosity in person ; — Yet — NATHAN .
Yet I ’ m but a Jew . — That was your meaning .
DAYA .
You better know what was my meaning , Nathan .
NATHAN .
Well , well , no more of this , DAYA .
I shall be silent ; But what of sinful in the eye of heaven Springs out of it — not I , not I could help ; It falls upon thy head .
NATHAN .
So let it , Daya .
Where is she then ?
What stays her ?
Surely , surely , You ’ re not amusing me — And does she know That I ’ m arrived ?
DAYA .
That you yourself must speak to , Terror still vibrates in her every nerve .
Her fancy mingles fire with all she thinks of .
Asleep , her soul seems busy ; but awake , Absent : now less than brute , now more than angel .
NATHAN .
Poor thing !
What are we mortals — DAYA .
As she lay This morning sleeping , all at once she started And cried : “ list , list !
there come my father ’ s camels ! ” And then she drooped again upon her pillow And I withdrew — when , lo !
you really came .
Her thoughts have only been with you — and him .
NATHAN .
And _ him _ ?
What him ?
DAYA .
With him , who from the fire Preserved her life , NATHAN .
Who was it ?
Where is he , That saved my Recha for me ?
DAYA .
A young templar , Brought hither captive a few days ago , And pardoned by the Sultan .
NATHAN .
How , a _ templar _ Dismissed with life by Saladin .
In truth , Not a less miracle was to preserve her , God ! — God ! — DAYA .
Without this man , who risked afresh The Sultan ’ s unexpected boon , we ’ d lost her .
NATHAN .
Where is he , Daya , where ’ s this noble youth ?
Do , lead me to his feet .
Sure , sure you gave him What treasures I had left you — gave him all , Promised him more — much more ?
DAYA .
How could we ?
NATHAN .
Not ?
DAYA .
He came , he went , we know not whence , or whither .
Quite unacquainted with the house , unguided But by his ear , he prest through smoke and flame , His mantle spread before him , to the room Whence pierced the shrieks for help ; and we began To think him lost — and her ; when , all at once , Bursting from flame and smoke , he stood before us , She in his arm upheld .
Cold and unmoved By our loud warmth of thanks , he left his booty , Struggled into the crowd , and disappeared .
NATHAN .
But not for ever , Daya , I would hope .
DAYA .
For some days after , underneath you palms , That shade his grave who rose again from death , We saw him wandering up and down .
I went , With transport went to thank him .
I conjured , Intreated him to visit once again The dear sweet girl he saved , who longed to shed At her preserver ’ s feet the grateful tear — NATHAN .
Well ?
DAYA .
But in vain .
Deaf to our warmest prayers , On me he flung such bitter mockery — NATHAN .
That hence rebuffed — DAYA .
Oh , no , oh , no , indeed not , Daily I forced myself upon him , daily Afresh encountered his dry taunting speeches .
Much I have borne , and would have borne much more : But he of late forbears his lonely walk Under the scattered palms , which stand about Our holy sepulchre : nor have I learnt Where he now is .
You seem astonished — thoughtful — NATHAN .
I was imagining what strange impressions This conduct makes on such a mind as Recha ’ s .
Disdained by one whom she must feel compelled To venerate and to esteem so highly .
At once attracted and repelled — the combat Between her head and heart must yet endure , Regret , Resentment , in unusual struggle .
Neither , perhaps , obtains the upper hand , And busy fancy , meddling in the fray , Weaves wild enthusiasms to her dazzled spirit , Now clothing Passion in the garb of Reason , And Reason now in Passion ’ s — do I err ?
This last is Recha ’ s fate — Romantic notions — DAYA .
Aye ; but such pious , lovely , sweet , illusions .
NATHAN .
Illusions though .
DAYA .
Yes : and the one , her bosom Clings to most fondly , is , that the brave templar Was but a transient inmate of the earth , A guardian angel , such as from her childhood She loved to fancy kindly hovering round her , Who from his veiling cloud amid the fire Stepped forth in her preserver ’ s form .
You smile — Who knows ?
At least beware of banishing So pleasing an illusion — if deceitful Christian , Jew , Mussulman , agree to own it , And ’ tis — at least to her — a dear illusion .
NATHAN .
Also to me .
Go , my good Daya , go , See what she ’ s after .
Can ’ t I speak with her ?
Then I ’ ll find out our untamed guardian angel , Bring him to sojourn here awhile among us — We ’ ll pinion his wild wing , when once he ’ s taken .
DAYA .
You undertake too much .
NATHAN .
And when , my Daya , This sweet illusion yields to sweeter truth , ( For to a man a man is ever dearer Than any angel ) you must not be angry To see our loved enthusiast exercised .
DAYA .
You are so good — and yet so sly .
I ’ ll seek her , But listen , — yes !
she ’ s coming of herself .
NATHAN , DAYA , _ and _ RECHA .
RECHA .
And you are here , your very self , my father , I thought you ’ d only sent your voice before you .
Where are you then ?
What mountains , deserts , torrents , Divide us now ?
You see me , face to face , And do not hasten to embrace your Recha .
Poor Recha !
she was almost burnt alive , But only — only — almost .
Do not shudder !
O ’ tis a horrid end to die in fire !
NATHAN ( _ embracing her _ ) .
My child , my darling child !
RECHA .
You had to cross The Jordan , Tigris , and Euphrates , and Who knows what rivers else .
I used to tremble And quake for you , till the fire came so nigh me ; Since then , methinks ’ twere comfort , balm , refreshment , To die by water .
But you are not drowned — I am not burnt alive . — We will rejoice — We will praise God — the kind good God , who bore thee , Upon the buoyant wings of _ unseen _ angels , Across the treacherous stream — the God who bade My angel _ visibly _ on his white wing Athwart the roaring flame — NATHAN ( _ aside _ ) .
White wing ? — oh , aye The broad white fluttering mantle of the templar .
RECHA .
Yes , visibly he bore me through the fire , O ’ ershadowed by his pinions . — Face to face I ’ ve seen an angel , father , my own angel .
NATHAN .
Recha deserves it , and would see in him No fairer form than he beheld in her , RECHA .
Whom are you flattering , father — tell me now — The angel , or yourself ?
NATHAN .
Yet had a man , A man of those whom Nature daily fashions , Done you this service , he to you had seemed , Had been an angel .
RECHA .
No , not such a one .
Indeed it was a true and real angel .
And have not you yourself instructed me How possible it is there may be angels ; That God for those who love him can work miracles — And I do love him , father — NATHAN .
And he thee ; And both for thee , and all like thee , my child , Works daily wonders , from eternity Has wrought them for you .
RECHA .
That I like to hear .
NATHAN .
Well , and although it sounds quite natural , An every day event , a simple story , That you was by a real templar saved , Is it the less a miracle ?
The greatest Of all is this , that true and real wonders Should happen so perpetually , so daily .
Without this universal miracle A thinking man had scarcely called those such , Which only children , Recha , ought to name so , Who love to gape and stare at the unusual And hunt for novelty — DAYA .
Why will you then With such vain subtleties , confuse her brain Already overheated ?
NATHAN .
Let me manage . — And is it not enough then for my Recha To owe her preservation to a man , Whom no small miracle preserved himself .
For whoe ’ er heard before that Saladin Let go a templar ; that a templar wished it , Hoped it , or for his ransom offered more Than taunts , his leathern sword-belt , or his dagger ?
RECHA .
That makes for me ; these are so many reasons He was no real knight , but only seemed it .
If in Jerusalem no captive templar , Appears alive , or freely wanders round , How could I find one , in the night , to save me ?
NATHAN .
Ingenious !
dextrous !
Daya , come in aid .
It was from you I learnt he was a prisoner ; Doubtless you know still more about him , speak .
DAYA .
’ Tis but report indeed , but it is said That Saladin bestowed upon this youth His gracious pardon for the strong resemblance He bore a favourite brother — dead , I think These twenty years — his name , I know it not — He fell , I don ’ t know where — and all the story Sounds so incredible , that very likely The whole is mere invention , talk , romance .
NATHAN .
And why incredible ?
Would you reject This story , tho ’ indeed , it ’ s often done , To fix on something more incredible , And give that faith ?
Why should not Saladin , Who loves so singularly all his kindred , Have loved in early youth with warmer fondness A brother now no more .
Do we not see Faces alike , and is an old impression Therefore a lost one ?
Do resembling features Not call up like emotions .
Where ’ s th ’ incredible ?
Surely , sage Daya , this can be to thee No miracle , or do _ thy _ wonders only Demand — I should have said _ deserve _ belief ?
DAYA .
You ’ re on the bite .
NATHAN .
Were you quite fair with me ?
Yet even so , my Recha , thy escape Remains a wonder , only possible To Him , who of the proud pursuits of princes Makes sport — or if not sport — at least delights To head and manage them by slender threads .
RECHA .
If I do err , it is not wilfully , My father .
NATHAN .
No , you have been always docile .
See now , a forehead vaulted thus , or thus — A nose bow ’ d one way rather than another — Eye-brows with straiter , or with sharper curve — A line , a mole , a wrinkle , a mere nothing I ’ th ’ countenance of an European savage — And thou — art saved , in Asia , from the fire .
Ask ye for signs and wonders after that ?
What need of calling angels into play ?
DAYA .
But Nathan , where ’ s the harm , if I may speak , Of fancying one ’ s self by an angel saved , Rather than by a man ?
Methinks it brings us Just so much the nearer the incomprehensive First cause of preservation .
NATHAN .
Pride , rank pride !
The iron pot would with a silver prong Be lifted from the furnace — to imagine Itself a silver vase .
Paha !
Where ’ s the harm ?
Thou askest .
Where ’ s the good ?
I might reply .
For thy _ it brings us nearer to the Godhead _ Is nonsense , Daya , if not blasphemy .
But it does harm : yes , yes , it does indeed .
Attend now .
To the being , who preserved you , Be he an angel or a man , you both , And thou especially wouldst gladly show Substantial services in just requital .
Now to an angel what great services Have ye the power to do ?
To sing his praise — Melt in transporting contemplation o ’ er him — Fast on his holiday — and squander alms — What nothingness of use !
To me at least It seems your neighbour gains much more than he By all this pious glow .
Not by your fasting Is he made fat ; not by your squandering , rich ; Nor by your transports is his glory exalted ; Nor by your faith his might .
But to a man — DAYA .
Why yes ; a man indeed had furnished us With more occasions to be useful to him .
God knows how readily we should have seized them .
But then he would have nothing — wanted nothing — Was in himself wrapped up , and self-sufficient , As angels are .
RECHA .
And when at last he vanished — NATHAN .
Vanished ?
How vanished ?
Underneath the palms Escaped your view , and has returned no more .
Or have you really sought for him elsewhere ?
DAYA .
No , that indeed we ’ ve not .
NATHAN .
Not , Daya , not ?
See it does harm , hard-hearted , cold enthusiasts , What if this angel on a bed of illness — RECHA .
Illness ?
DAYA .
Ill !
sure he is not .
RECHA .
A cold shudder Creeps over me ; O Daya , feel my forehead , It was so warm , ’ tis now as chill as ice .
NATHAN .
He is a Frank , unused to this hot climate , Is young , and to the labours of his calling , To fasting , watching , quite unused — RECHA .
Ill — ill !
DAYA .
Thy father only means ’ twere possible .
NATHAN .
And there he lies , without a friend , or money To buy him friends — RECHA .
Alas !
my father .
NATHAN .
Lies Without advice , attendance , converse , pity , The prey of agony , of death — RECHA .
Where — where ?
NATHAN .
He , who , for one he never knew , or saw — It is enough for him he is a man — Plunged into fire .
DAYA .
O Nathan , Nathan , spare her .
NATHAN .
Who cared not to know aught of her he saved , Declined her presence to escape her thanks — DAYA .
Do , spare her !
NATHAN .
Did not wish to see her more Unless it were a second time to save her — Enough for him he is a man — DAYA .
Stop , look !
NATHAN .
He — he , in death , has nothing to console him , But the remembrance of this deed .
DAYA .
You kill her !
NATHAN .
And you kill him — or might have done at least — Recha ’ tis medicine I give , not poison .
He lives — come to thyself — may not be ill — Not even ill — RECHA .
Surely not dead , not dead .
NATHAN .
Dead surely not — for God rewards the good Done here below , here too .
Go ; but remember How easier far devout enthusiasm is Than a good action ; and how willingly Our indolence takes up with pious rapture , Tho ’ at the time unconscious of its end , Only to save the toil of useful deeds .
RECHA .
Oh never leave again thy child alone ! — But can he not be only gone a journey ?
NATHAN .
Yes , very likely .
There ’ s a Mussulman Numbering with curious eye my laden camels , Do you know who he is ?
DAYA .
Oh , your old dervis .
NATHAN .
Who — who ?
DAYA .
Your chess companion .
NATHAN .
That , Al-Hafi ?
DAYA .
And now the treasurer of Saladin .
NATHAN .
Al-Hafi ?
Are you dreaming ?
How was this ?
In fact it is so .
He seems coming hither .
In with you quick . — What now am I to hear ?
NATHAN _ and _ HAFI .
HAFI .
Aye , lift thine eyes in wonder .
NATHAN .
Is it you ?
A dervis so magnificent ! — HAFI .
Why not ?
Can nothing then be made out of a dervis ?
NATHAN .
Yes , surely ; but I have been wont to think A dervis , that ’ s to say a thorough dervis , Will allow nothing to be made of him .
HAFI .
May-be ’ tis true that I ’ m no thorough dervis ; But by the prophet , when we must — NATHAN .
Must , Hafi ?
Needs must — belongs to no man : and a dervis — HAFI .
When he is much besought , and thinks it right , A dervis must .
NATHAN .
Well spoken , by our God !
Embrace me , man , you ’ re still , I trust , my friend .
HAFI .
Why not ask first what has been made of me ?
NATHAN .
Ask climbers to look back !
HAFI .
And may I not Have grown to such a creature in the state That my old friendship is no longer welcome ?
NATHAN .
If you still bear your dervis-heart about you I ’ ll run the risk of that .
Th ’ official robe Is but your cloak .
HAFI .
A cloak , that claims some honour .
What think ’ st thou ?
At a court of thine how great Had been Al-Hafi ?
NATHAN .
Nothing but a dervis .
If more , perhaps — what shall I say — my cook .
HAFI .
In order to unlearn my native trade .
Thy cook — why not thy butler too ?
The Sultan , He knows me better , I ’ m his treasurer .
NATHAN .
You , you ?
HAFI .
Mistake not — of the lesser purse — His father manages the greater still — The purser of his household .
NATHAN .
That ’ s not small .
HAFI .
’ Tis larger than thou think ’ st ; for every beggar Is of his household .
NATHAN .
He ’ s so much their foe — HAFI .
That he ’ d fain root them out — with food and raiment — Tho ’ he turn beggar in the enterprize .
NATHAN .
Bravo , I meant so .
HAFI .
And he ’ s almost such .
His treasury is every day , ere sun-set , Poorer than empty ; and how high so e ’ er Flows in the morning tide , ’ tis ebb by noon .
NATHAN .
Because it circulates through such canals As can be neither stopped , nor filled .
HAFI .
Thou hast it .
NATHAN .
I know it well .
HAFI .
Nathan , ’ tis woeful doing When kings are vultures amid caresses : But when they ’ re caresses amid the vultures ’ Tis ten times worse .
NATHAN .
No , dervis , no , no , no .
