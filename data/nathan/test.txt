HAFI .
Thou mayst well talk so .
Now then , let me hear What wouldst thou give me to resign my office ?
NATHAN .
What does it bring you in ?
HAFI .
To me , not much ; But thee , it might indeed enrich : for when , As often happens , money is at ebb , Thou couldst unlock thy sluices , make advances , And take in form of interest all thou wilt .
NATHAN .
And interest upon interest of the interest — HAFI .
Certainly .
NATHAN .
Till my capital becomes All interest .
HAFI .
How — that does not take with thee ?
Then write a finis to our book of friendship ; For I have reckoned on thee .
NATHAN .
How so , Hafi ?
HAFI .
That thou wouldst help me to go thro ’ my office With credit , grant me open chest with thee — Dost shake thy head ?
NATHAN .
Let ’ s understand each other .
Here ’ s a distinction to be made .
To you , To dervis Hafi , all I have is open ; But to the defterdar of Saladin , To that Al-Hafi — HAFI .
Spoken like thyself !
Thou hast been ever no less kind than cautious .
The two Al-Hafis thou distinguishest Shall soon be parted .
See this coat of honour , Which Saladin bestowed — before ’ tis worn To rags , and suited to a dervis ’ back , — Will in Jerusalem hang upon the hook ; While I along the Ganges scorching strand , Amid my teachers shall be wandering barefoot .
NATHAN .
That ’ s like you .
HAFI .
Or be playing chess among them .
NATHAN .
Your sovereign good .
HAFI .
What dost thou think seduced me .
The wish of having not to beg in future — The pride of acting the rich man to beggars — Would these have metamorphosed a rich beggar So suddenly into a poor rich man ?
NATHAN .
No , I think not .
HAFI .
A sillier , sillier weakness , For the first time my vanity was tempter , Flattered by Saladin ’ s good-hearted notion — NATHAN .
Which was ?
HAFI .
That all a beggar ’ s wants are only Known to a beggar : such alone can tell How to relieve them usefully and wisely .
“ Thy predecessor was too cold for me , ( He said ) and when he gave , he gave unkindly ; Informed himself with too precautious strictness Concerning the receiver , not content To leant the want , unless he knew its cause , And measuring out by that his niggard bounty .
Thou wilt not thus bestow .
So harshly kind Shall Saladin not seem in thee .
Thou art not Like the choked pipe , whence sullied and by spurts Flow the pure waters it absorbs in silence .
Al-Hafi thinks and feels like me . ” So nicely The fowler whistled , that at last the quail Ran to his net .
Cheated , and by a cheat — NATHAN .
Tush !
dervis , gently .
HAFI .
What !
and is ’ t not cheating , Thus to oppress mankind by hundred thousands , To squeeze , grind , plunder , butcher , and torment , And act philanthropy to individuals ? — Not cheating — thus to ape from the Most High The bounty , which alike on mead and desert , Upon the just and the unrighteous , falls In sunshine or in showers , and not possess The never-empty hand of the Most High ? — Not cheating — NATHAN .
Cease !
HAFI .
Of my own cheating sure It is allowed to speak .
Were it not cheating To look for the fair side of these impostures , In order , under colour of its fairness , To gain advantage from them — ha ?
NATHAN .
Al-Hafi , Go to your desert quickly .
Among men I fear you ’ ll soon unlearn to be a man .
HAFI .
And so do I — farewell .
NATHAN .
What , so abruptly ?
Stay , stay , Al-Hafi ; has the desert wings ?
Man , ’ twill not run away , I warrant you — Hear , hear , I want you — want to talk with you — He ’ s gone .
I could have liked to question him About our templar .
He will likely know him .
NATHAN _ and _ DAYA .
DAYA ( _ bursting in _ ) .
O Nathan , Nathan !
NATHAN .
Well , what now ?
DAYA .
He ’ s there .
He shows himself again .
NATHAN .
Who , Daya , who ?
DAYA .
He !
he !
NATHAN .
When cannot He be seen ?
Indeed Your He is only one ; that should not be , Were he an angel even .
DAYA .
’ Neath the palms He wanders up and down , and gathers dates .
NATHAN .
And eats ? — and as a templar ?
DAYA .
How you tease us !
Her eager eye espied him long ago , While he scarce gleamed between the further stems , And follows him most punctually .
Go , She begs , conjures you , go without delay ; And from the window will make signs to you Which way his rovings bend .
Do , do make haste .
NATHAN .
What !
thus , as I alighted from my camel , Would that be decent ?
Swift , do you accost him , Tell him of my return .
I do not doubt , His delicacy in the master ’ s absence Forbore my house ; but gladly will accept The father ’ s invitation .
Say , I ask him , Most heartily request him — DAYA .
All in vain !
In short , he will not visit any Jew .
NATHAN .
Then do thy best endeavours to detain him , Or with thine eyes to watch his further haunt , Till I rejoin you .
I shall not be long .
SCENE . — A Place of Palms .
_ The _ TEMPLAR _ walking to and fro _ , _ a _ FRIAR _ following him at some distance _ , _ as if desirous of addressing him _ .
TEMPLAR .
This fellow does not follow me for pastime .
How skaunt he eyes his hands !
Well , my good brother — Perhaps I should say , father ; ought I not ?
FRIAR .
No — brother — a lay-brother at your service .
TEMPLAR .
Well , brother , then ; if I myself had something — But — but , by God , I ’ ve nothing .
FRIAR .
Thanks the same ; And God reward your purpose thousand-fold !
The will , and not the deed , makes up the giver .
Nor was I sent to follow you for alms — TEMPLAR .
Sent then ?
FRIAR .
Yes , from the monastery .
TEMPLAR .
Where I was just now in hopes of coming in For pilgrims ’ fare .
FRIAR .
They were already at table : But if it suit with you to turn directly — TEMPLAR .
Why so ?
’ Tis true , I have not tasted meat This long time .
What of that ?
The dates are ripe .
FRIAR .
O with that fruit go cautiously to work .
Too much of it is hurtful , sours the humours , Makes the blood melancholy .
TEMPLAR .
And if I Choose to be melancholy — For this warning You were not sent to follow me , I ween .
FRIAR .
Oh , no : I only was to ask about you , And feel your pulse a little .
TEMPLAR .
And you tell me Of that yourself ?
FRIAR .
Why not ?
TEMPLAR .
A deep one !
troth : And has your cloister more such ?
FRIAR .
I can ’ t say .
Obedience is our bounden duty .
TEMPLAR .
So — And you obey without much scrupulous questioning ?
FRIAR .
Were it obedience else , good sir ?
TEMPLAR .
How is it The simple mind is ever in the right ?
May you inform me who it is that wishes To know more of me ?
’ Tis not you yourself , I dare be sworn .
FRIAR .
Would it become me , sir , Or benefit me ?
TEMPLAR .
Whom can it become , Whom can it benefit , to be so curious ?
FRIAR .
The patriarch , I presume — ’ twas he that sent me .
TEMPLAR .
The patriarch ?
Knows he not my badge , the cross Of red on the white mantle ?
FRIAR .
Can I say ?
TEMPLAR .
Well , brother , well !
I am a templar , taken Prisoner at Tebnin , whose exalted fortress , Just as the truce expired , we sought to climb , In order to push forward next to Sidon .
I was the twentieth captive , but the only Pardoned by Saladin — with this , the patriarch Knows all , or more than his occasions ask .
FRIAR .
And yet no more than he already knows , I think .
But why alone of all the captives Thou hast been spared , he fain would learn — TEMPLAR .
Can I Myself tell that ?
Already , with bare neck , I kneeled upon my mantle , and awaited The blow — when Saladin with steadfast eye Fixed me , sprang nearer to me , made a sign — I was upraised , unbound , about to thank him — And saw his eye in tears .
Both stand in silence .
He goes .
I stay .
How all this hangs together , Thy patriarch may unriddle .
FRIAR .
He concludes , That God preserved you for some mighty deed .
TEMPLAR .
Some mighty deed ?
To save out of the fire A Jewish girl — to usher curious pilgrims About Mount Sinai — to — FRIAR .
The time may come — And this is no such trifle — but perhaps The patriarch meditates a weightier office .
TEMPLAR .
Think you so , brother ?
Has he hinted aught ?
FRIAR .
Why , yes ; I was to sift you out a little , And hear if you were one to — TEMPLAR .
Well — to what ?
I ’ m curious to observe how this man sifts .
FRIAR .
The shortest way will be to tell you plainly What are the patriarch ’ s wishes .
TEMPLAR .
And they are — FRIAR .
To send a letter by your hand .
TEMPLAR .
By me ?
I am no carrier .
And were that an office More meritorious than to save from burning A Jewish maid ?
FRIAR .
So it should seem ; must seem — For , says the patriarch , to all Christendom This letter is of import ; and to bear it Safe to its destination , says the patriarch , God will reward with a peculiar crown In heaven ; and of this crown , the patriarch says , No one is worthier than you — TEMPLAR .
Than I ?
FRIAR .
For none so able , and so fit to earn This crown , the patriarch says , as you .
TEMPLAR .
As I ?
FRIAR .
The patriarch here is free , can look about him , And knows , he says , how cities may be stormed , And how defended ; knows , he says , the strengths And weaknesses of Saladin ’ s new bulwark , And of the inner rampart last thrown up ; And to the warriors of the Lord , he says , Could clearly point them out ; — TEMPLAR .
And can I know Exactly the contents of this same letter ?
FRIAR .
Why , that I don ’ t pretend to vouch exactly — ’ Tis to King Philip : and our patriarch — I often wonder how this holy man , Who lives so wholly to his God and heaven , Can stoop to be so well informed about Whatever passes here — ’ Tis a hard task !
TEMPLAR .
Well — and your patriarch — FRIAR .
Knows , with great precision , And from sure hands , how , when , and with what force , And in which quarter , Saladin , in case The war breaks out afresh , will take the field .
TEMPLAR .
He knows that ?
FRIAR .
Yes ; and would acquaint King Philip , That he may better calculate , if really The danger be so great as to require Him to renew at all events the truce So bravely broken by your body .
TEMPLAR .
So ?
This is a patriarch indeed !
He wants No common messenger ; he wants a spy .
Go tell your patriarch , brother , I am not , As far as you can sift , the man to suit him .
I still esteem myself a prisoner , and A templar ’ s only calling is to fight , And not to ferret out intelligence .
FRIAR .
That ’ s much as I supposed , and , to speak plainly , Not to be blamed .
The best is yet behind .
The patriarch has made out the very fortress , Its name , and strength , and site on Libanon , Wherein the mighty sums are now concealed , With which the prudent father of the sultan Provides the cost of war , and pays the army .
He knows that Saladin , from time to time , Goes to this fortress , through by-ways and passe With few attendants .
TEMPLAR .
Well — FRIAR .
How easy ’ twere To seize his person in these expeditions , And make an end of all !
You shudder , sir — Two Maronites , who fear the Lord , have offer To share the danger of the enterprise , Under a proper leader .
TEMPLAR .
And the patriarch Had cast his eye on me for this brave office ?
FRIAR .
He thinks King Philip might from Ptolemais Best second such a deed .
TEMPLAR .
On me ?
on me ?
Have you not heard then , just now heard , the favour Which I received from Saladin ?
FRIAR .
Oh , yes !
TEMPLAR .
And yet ?
FRIAR .
The patriarch thinks — that ’ s mighty well — God , and the order ’ s interest — TEMPLAR .
Alter nothing , Command no villainies .
FRIAR .
No , that indeed not ; But what is villainy in human eyes May in the sight of God , the patriarch thinks , Not be — TEMPLAR .
I owe my life to Saladin , And might take his ?
FRIAR .
That — fie !
But Saladin , The patriarch thinks , is yet the common foe Of Christendom , and cannot earn a right To be your friend .
TEMPLAR .
My friend — because I will not Behave like an ungrateful scoundrel to him .
FRIAR .
Yet gratitude , the patriarch thinks , is not A debt before the eye of God or man , Unless for our own sakes the benefit Had been conferred ; and , it has been reported , The patriarch understands that Saladin Preserved your life merely because your voice , Your air , or features , raised a recollection Of his lost brother .
TEMPLAR .
He knows this ?
and yet — If it were sure , I should — ah , Saladin !
How !
and shall nature then have formed in me A single feature in thy brother ’ s likeness , With nothing in my soul to answer to it ?
Or what does correspond shall I suppress To please a patriarch ?
So thou dost not cheat us , Nature — and so not contradict Thyself , Kind God of all . — Go , brother , go away : Do not stir up my anger .
FRIAR .
I withdraw More gladly than I came .
We cloister-folk Are forced to vow obedience to superiors .
&#91; _ Goes _ .
TEMPLAR _ and _ DAYA .
DAYA .
The monk , methinks , left him in no good mood : But I must risk my message .
TEMPLAR .
Better still The proverb says that monks and women are The devil ’ s clutches ; and I ’ m tossed to-day From one to th ’ other .
DAYA .
Whom do I behold ? — Thank God !
I see you , noble knight , once more .
Where have you lurked this long , long space ?
You ’ ve not Been ill ?
TEMPLAR .
No .
DAYA .
Well , then ?
TEMPLAR .
Yes .
DAYA .
We ’ ve all been anxious Lest something ailed you .
TEMPLAR .
So ?
DAYA .
Have you been journeying ?
TEMPLAR .
Hit off !
DAYA .
How long returned ?
TEMPLAR .
Since yesterday .
DAYA .
Our Recha ’ s father too is just returned , And now may Recha hope at last — TEMPLAR .
For what ?
DAYA .
For what she often has requested of you .
Her father pressingly invites your visit .
He now arrives from Babylon , with twenty High-laden camels , brings the curious drugs , And precious stones , and stuffs , he has collected From Syria , Persia , India , even China .
TEMPLAR .
I am no chap .
DAYA .
His nation honours him , As if he were a prince , and yet to hear him Called the _ wise _ Nathan by them , not the _ rich _ , Has often made me wonder .
TEMPLAR .
To his nation Are _ rich _ and _ wise _ perhaps of equal import .
DAYA .
But above all he should be called the _ good _ .
You can ’ t imagine how much goodness dwells Within him .
Since he has been told the service You rendered to his Recha , there is nothing That he would grudge you .
TEMPLAR .
Aye ?
DAYA .
Do — see him , try him .
TEMPLAR .
A burst of feeling soon is at an end .
DAYA .
And do you think that I , were he less kind , Less bountiful , had housed with him so long : That I don ’ t feel my value as a Christian : For ’ twas not o ’ er my cradle said , or sung , That I to Palestina should pursue My husband ’ s steps , only to educate A Jewess .
My husband was a noble page In Emperor Frederic ’ s army .
TEMPLAR .
And by birth A Switzer , who obtained the gracious honour Of drowning in one river with his master .
Woman , how often you have told me this !
Will you ne ’ er leave off persecuting me ?
DAYA .
My Jesus !
persecute — TEMPLAR .
Aye , persecute .
Observe then , I henceforward will not see , Not hear you , nor be minded of a deed Over and over , which I did unthinking , And which , when thought about , I wonder at .
I wish not to repent it ; but , remember , Should the like accident occur again , ’ Twill be your fault if I proceed more coolly , Ask a few questions , and let burn what ’ s burning .
DAYA .
My God forbid !
TEMPLAR .
From this day forth , good woman , Do me at least the favour not to know me : I beg it of you ; and don ’ t send the father .
A Jew ’ s a Jew , and I am rude and bearish .
The image of the maid is quite erased Out of my soul — if it was ever there — DAYA .
But yours remains with her .
TEMPLAR .
Why so — what then — Wherefore give harbour to it ? — DAYA .
Who knows wherefore ?
Men are not always what they seem to be .
TEMPLAR .
They ’ re seldom better than they seem to be .
DAYA .
Ben ’ t in this hurry .
TEMPLAR .
Pray , forbear to make These palm-trees odious .
I have loved to walk here .
DAYA .
Farewell then , bear .
Yet I must track the savage .
ACT II .
SCENE . — The Sultan ’ s Palace . — An outer room of Sittah ’ s apartment .
SALADIN _ and _ SITTAH , _ playing chess _ .
SITTAH .
Wherefore so absent , brother ?
How you play !
SALADIN .
Not well ?
I thought — SITTAH .
Yes ; very well for me , Take back that move .
SALADIN .
Why ?
SITTAH .
Don ’ t you see the knight Becomes exposed ?
SALADIN .
’ Tis true : then so .
SITTAH .
And so I take the pawn .
SALADIN .
That ’ s true again .
Then , check !
SITTAH .
That cannot help you .
When my king is castled All will be safe .
SALADIN .
But out of my dilemma ’ Tis not so easy to escape unhurt .
Well , you must have the knight .
SITTAH .
I will not have him , I pass him by .
SALADIN .
In that , there ’ s no forbearance : The place is better than the piece .
SITTAH .
Maybe .
SALADIN .
Beware you reckon not without your host : This stroke you did not think of .
SITTAH .
No , indeed ; I did not think you tired of your queen .
SALADIN .
My queen ?
SITTAH .
Well , well !
I find that I to-day Shall earn a thousand dinars to an asper .
SALADIN .
How so , my sister ?
